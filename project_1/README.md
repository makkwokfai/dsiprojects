### Problem Statement

The question is what actions can be taken to increase the partipation rates among the high school students in taking the SAT exam?


### Summary

This project examines data covering participation rates and scores for students taking the SAT and ACT college entrance exams. The data are organized at the state level and contrain 2017 and 2018 particpation rates and Total, Composite and component scores. This allows for a state-by-state comparison of participation rates and scores for each test.

The data set is consistent with the observation that many states mandate one of two tests as a requirement for high school graduation and the notioon that students are likely to take only one of the two test. Furthermore, a strong negative relationship between test participation and average test score is found. This means that states with low participation rates for a given test aare likely to see higher average scores than a state with high participation rates of the same test. 

### Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on both an examination of the data and a review of the state college entrance exam testing policy, it is clear that participation in such tests is heavily influenced by sstate policy towards testing. Currently, more than 50% of the states require that high school students take either the SAT or the ACT exam.

To increase particpation, states which have not already done so can consider making the exam a mandatory high school graduation requirement. This policy provides several benefits to the education system and the students. One benefit is that it provides a college-level standardized test that can be used to benchmark students and to measure the efficency of high-school educational systems. Students are able to benefit from the system as knowing their score can be useful in directing them to consider the appropriate schools.

Further research into other influential factors, particularly into the benefits to students of taking SAT or ACT exam, would be helpful to developing a strategy for increasing participation.
