0,computing,PC Not Turning On,"My PC started acting weird about a week ago. It would switch to a black screen and would pretty much shut off, meaning I couldn’t do anything, even though it had the indicators that it was still on. I thought I had fixed the problem by turning the max overheat level higher, to 87 degrees. Keep in mind that before this, my computer had never shut off due to overheating. Today I turned it on then left to make food. When I came back to do stuff it had apparently done the same thing that it did before, where it would go to a black screen. I shut it off and turn it back on again, black screen immediately. Did it again same thing, did it again, computer wouldn’t turn on. No fans or light on power switch, only light on keyboard. I went through and cleaned the dust, made sure everything was in their sockets properly, didn’t fix it. I haven’t opened my computer in a while, so I don’t know if this is normal, but the motherboard seemed kind of flimsy. I don’t know what to do now, and I need to do some school work. I can do it on my iPad, but i would rather do it on my computer.

Edit: Before when the computer was working, there was an orange light emitting from the motherboard on the side where the usb ports are. It’s always been there, and i never encountered problems until now."

6,computing,Computer vs. Laptop ..,"I have a dedicated desktop setup in one room; in another I have a stand-up desk with a treadmill under it.  I have an old laptop that I have hooked up over there to a keyboard, mouse, and monitor.  The old laptop barely runs WOW.

My thought is to run a long HDMI cable into the other room and then just add the additional monitor as a 'duplicate' of the desktop monitor in the host room.

I run into the issue of then having to run XX feet of USB cable for the mouse and keyboard on that desk in that room.  And then there's the question of how to duplicate sound at that station.  Unless there's a better option for all of these things?

8,computing,Are cellphones no fun?,"Cell phones have a lot of hype around them and in commericals people are always really enjoying their phones.  I don't enjoy my cell phone.  Out of the tech I own (computer, laptop) my cell phone is my least loved device.

I find they have little to no customization. My phone is always telling me I can't do or making what I want to do difficult. It doesn't let me easily decide where to store files/apps, decide what runs when, see what is currently running on my system.  Repair of cell phones is a pain!  I own all the things you need, including a heat gun and full soldering iron setup, and it is still no fun and there's never a way to upgrade or customize my phone.

Apps and games are all subpar to their laptop/computer counterparts.  

I'm a woman in my mid-thirties and the damn phones make me feel old and grumpy. Even though I pay for my phone and keep it repaired, I feel like it isn't actually my device.

My LG M210 finally bit the dust earlier this week and I've got another midline phone on the way.

Do you guys like your phone?  Am I just too used to the GUIs on computers to adapt?  What is the best phone for customization and tinkering around.

10,computing,PC Not turning on!,"I built a new PC in the last week or so but kept my old PSU which I bought 3 years ago (EVGA 750 GQ, 80+ Gold 750W).

Since completing the build there is a delay of maybe a second between pressing the power button and my PC starting up. I thought nothing of it. However, 3 days ago my PC didn't power on. I took it apart and thought maybe some cables were touching the back of the mobo etc so moved them about and it worked fine.

Next day, power button, PC didn't turn on. Took apart, moved cables, power button and it turned on.

Today I pressed the power button and nothing happened. I unplugged all the cables one by one, still didn't power on. I then took the power cable out and then put it back in maybe 5 secs later and it powered on.

I'm sure I know the answer which is probably my PSU but does anyone know for sure whats the issue? The optimist in me is hoping I need a new CMOS battery but I'm guessing I'm going to need a new PSU unless anyone else has any ideas?

13,computing,[Research] Castle in the Sky: Dynamic Sky Replacement and Harmonization in Videos,"[Check out the paper presentation by 3-minute papers!](https://crossminds.ai/video/5fbeaf82550096d304510009/?playlist_id=5f07c51e2de531fe96279ccb)

**Abstract:**

We propose a vision-based method for video sky replacement and harmonization, which can automatically generate realistic and dramatic sky backgrounds in videos with controllable styles. Different from previous sky editing methods that either focus on static photos or require inertial measurement units integrated in smartphones on shooting videos, our method is purely vision-based, without any requirements on the capturing devices, and can be well applied to either online or offline processing scenarios. Our method runs in real-time and is free of user interactions. We decompose this artistic creation process into a couple of proxy tasks including sky matting, motion estimation, and image blending. Experiments are conducted on videos diversely captured in the wild by handheld smartphones and dash cameras, and show high fidelity and good generalization of our method in both visual quality and lighting/motion dynamics.

**Video Sky Augmentation:**

Our method produces vivid blending results with a high degree of realism and visual dynamics. With a single NVIDIA Titan XP GPU card, our method reaches a real-time processing speed (24 fps) at the output resolution of 640 x 320 and a near real-time processing speed (15 fps) at 854 x 480. The following gives several groups of our blending results on outdoor videos (floating castle, fire cloud, super moon, and galaxy night).

**Weather/Lighting Translation:**

As a by-product, our method can be also used for image weather and lighting translation. A potential application of our method is data augmentation. Domain gap between datasets with limited samples and the complex real-world poses great challenges for data-driven computer vision methods. For example, domain sensitive visual perception models in self-driving may face problems at night or rainy days due to the limited examples in training data. We believe our method has great potential for improving the generalization ability of deep learning models in a variety of computer vision tasks such as detection, segmentation, tracking, etc. This is one of our future work.

18,computing,Advice with notebook formatting,"Hello! 

I wanna ask some advice or help with formatting.

I have an oooold notebook from Dell (Inspiron N4110) with Windows 7 installed. It already got lots of formatting, mainly because I don't have money right now to buy a new one. Problem is, every now and then it get some problem again, and I'm very short on money to even send it to reformat again with professionals. Therefore, I decided to try formatting it myself. The worst I can get it's to give up and send it to technicians again. I already read/watched several articles/videos about formatting and how to get a bootable pendrive.

So, the current problem is that the explorer are crashing not long after initialization. Unfortunately I didn't create a restoration point to be back with default settings. :(

I wanna re-install windows 7, mainly because I have a serial number and would be nice not having to relay in ilegal versions. I am aware that 7 doesn't have support anymore. \*Theoretically\* I found an original ISO for, and prepared a pendrive with it using Rufus (3.13 version, I guess).

I followed the steps, but always get a ""operation system not found"" after the setup bios screen. Searching for sollutions, I discovered that some options of the boot screen aren't showing. I get that different notebooks will have slighty different bios screens, but I didn't found anything on the internet which was the same as my case.

When I enter the boot tab, I get \*only\* the order of inicialization. I'm able to put the usb option first, it shows my pen-drive, so it is recognizable. But there is no options to select UEFI or Legacy, disable secure boot and so on.

Basically all solutions I got say that I have to disable the secure boot option. But what if I get no option for that?

So, I don't know if the problem may be the ISO file detected, or if has to do with bios configuration. I'm willing to try download newer version of windows, but again, all the information I found talk about disable the secure option.

Any opinions? Thanks in advance!"

Dr. Biplav Srivastava, professor of computer science at the University of South Carolina, and his team have developed a data-driven tool that helps demonstrate the effect of wearing masks on COVID-19 cases and deaths. His model utilizes a variety of data sources to create alternate scenarios that can tell us “What could have happened?” if a county in the U.S. had a higher or lower rate of mask adherence. In this interview, he explains how the model works, its limitations and what conclusions we can draw from it.

This is a nationwide tool which can show the effect that wearing masks can have. If it’s a county where people wear masks regularly, it will show you how many COVID-19 cases and deaths they avoided. If you pick a county where people don’t wear masks, it will show you how many cases and deaths could have been prevented there."

40,computing,Windows server student question - DNS issue - 'Zone not loaded by DNS server',"I'm taking a windows server admin module as part of my CS degree. We are instructed to set up 3 VMs (two servers and a client) linked through an internal switch (within Virtual Box). We then have to connect these to the class router and ping to test the connection. Next we set up DNS, and create a web server with a few sites, and then load those sites on the VMs to test that they have been created correctly on the network. 

I've tried to follow everything fastidiously and double-check my settings, but there seems to be a DNS issue. The web server is showing 'Zone not loaded by DNS server', while the client machine can only load my web-page by IP address, not by domain name.

https://i.imgur.com/1Gn3CfW.png

When I go to my web server, I can see that the default website is stopped, but when I try to start it, it says that [another website may be using the same port](https://i.imgur.com/SamyxkH.png). I guess that will be my `Nameone` site, as I can see that is set to use port 80, it won't let me change the port. Can someone please tell me how to proceed? TIA

Another screencap - https://i.imgur.com/TBd8YA5.png

I ran a whole bunch of tests from the client VM, and have a test log I could share. There is obviously a pattern, but I'm too confused to know what it means. One thing I do notice is that the '88' site we set up that was supposed to connect through port 88, actually only does through port 80, so there is clearly something wrong there.

Are there really supposed to be both [`EPSILON` and `Epsilon\*****.net` under DNS](https://i.imgur.com/904P0XX.png)? Have I somehow done the same part of the labs twice and duplicated a whole bunch of settings, perhaps?

Edit: I think I've worked out that the 'default website' can safely be ignored. I've remembered that is was in fact 'my first site' that we created.

Edit2: is there something wrong here? It says an IP address is required for the name server, but there's none entered. https://i.imgur.com/1OiGS59.png

Edit3: `nslookup` results: https://i.imgur.com/ZBo3aae.png

Edit4: I just tried some ping tests, which clearly show a lot of details of the problem, but I still don't know how to solve it. In a nutshell, the client machine passed all ping tests. Oddly though, I notice it treats `mydomain.net` as `alpha.mydomain.net`. On the other hand, alpha failed every domain name ping test, *except* `mydomain.net`, which it again treated as `alpha.mydomain.net`. But when I pinged IP addresses, they all came back fine. So it seems that the problem is with alpha somehow, I guess...

Edit5: observed something very curious happening with `ping` on alpha. I can see that `mydomain.net` comes back fine whereas `www.mydomain.net` does not."

61,computing,I just learned about Dennard scaling and the true reason (as of the last 10 years) why computers haven't gotten much better in the last 10 years.,"So we all know Moore's law right? Transistor density and whatnot, well Dennard scaling is that, but for clock speed. After 2008, Dennard scaling has leveled off even though transistor density is still rising. The problem is that Dennard scaling was killed because of Moore's law because of microchip physics. Stuff about heat dissipation and smaller transistors having less blah, blah, blah. This is why overclocking computers involves better cooling methods like liquid cooling (I think).

From what I understand, Dennard scaling is pretty dependent on heat dissipation. Materials like silicone are okay at it, but there are better materials. The problem is that there hasn't been a good enough material to make up for the heat produced by smaller transistors. This is where graphene comes in. By using graphene, we can improve dissipation and allow for greater clock speeds. Most likely exceeding 10 GHz once we start making consumer electronics with graphene. 

This is pretty hard conjecture. I only learned about Dennard scaling about 2 hours ago, but this also means we have another avenue of improving computing power to maximize before we reach the absolute limit of classical computing. If there's already stories of graphene or other materials being used to speed up processing, please comment the link to the story. If I'm wrong about something please point it out."

66,computing,Questions about restoring modern laptops.,"Hi guys. I recently bought a Huawei D15 laptop, Windows 10 Home. It works nicely, but I have a little something that is bugging me:  it comes with a 512 GB SSD, but it's partitioned:   80GB for System (C:\\) and the rest for Info (D:\\). I know it has its conveniences to have a drive partitioned like this, but I don't like it. And being an OEM installation, I'm not sure if merging the partitions -if possible- would cause any trouble,  


Long ago, it was common to find CD's or DVD's containing your OS and drivers inside the box. Later, found a ""recovery media creation tool"" so I can burn my own discs and keep them safe.

However, this recent laptop doesn't have something like this. It has a feature to return the computer to factory state which is nice. I also find an option inside Windows to create a Recovery Drive on a usb stick.  


These are my 3 questions:

\- Is the recovery info stored in the HDD?

\- If the previous question is affirmative, would formatting or re-partitioning the disc erase this info? 

\- Will  this ""Recovery Drive""  return my Pc to factory state or reinstall a image of my current state?

70,computing,Fans loud after gpu upgrade in a hp z420,"So I have upgraded my GPU from a Quadro k2000 to a ASUS TUF 1650s as the Quadro k2000 is so trash in todays standards, and since I wanted to start gaming, i decided to replace the GPU. However, after replacing it, the fans are much louder than before at idle (it was silent and barely audiable) but now the fans just make a annoying loud hum and buzz at the same time.

I tried changing back to the Quadro k2000 and it became quiet again. the noise is mostly from the rear fan, which I tried connecting to the front fan connector via a DIY extender and its much quiet now. However, the computer boots up with a error 512, stating that the rear fan is not connected and i have to press f1 to skip that screen, which is very annoying for me. Also, I am kind of considered about the thermals, because I couldn't find anything online of how the HP z420 adjust the fan speed of the front and back fan automatically (CPU temperature, GPU temperature, or internal temperature) and is the back and front fan adjusted together or separately? how are the fans controlled and what sensors are they connected to? 

Also i tried using speedfan to try to adjust them but the fans simpily didnt show up. not even one

My guess is that the gpu might have a thermal sensor on it.

So how can i fix this problem?"

I'm not entirely new to computing, having rented and controlled servers for games before and also having learnt a bit of coding on the side (however minuscule my knowledge of that field may be). Simultaneously, I have created and hosted websites and bought domains before so I have some knowledge there too.

However, every source I've been to seems to have a different opinion.

This brings me to the crux of what I ask; **Where do I start with computing?**

86,computing,What should I do with this 250GB M.2?,"So I have a 2TB HDD, a 1TB HDD, and a 250GB M.2 SSD. What would be the best way to utilize the m.2 because obviously it can't store everything I have? Thanks."
87,computing,"Running out of space and need advice re. storage &amp; backup. Also, a question about drive icons.","So [this](https://i.imgur.com/UKrOV7j.jpg) is the state of my PC's drives at present, and as you can see, it's getting a little crowded.

Now I should say at the outset, that some of those drives are external, and it rather irritates me that it is not easy to tell which, judging by the drive icons. You will see that the two drives named 'expansion drive' have the appropriate icons that actually show what they really look like, which comes from the original .ico files that are stored on the drives. But my Seagate 160GB and Iomega drives have no such icons, and although I tried 3 times to create an .ico file for the Seagate, using a suitable image converted to .ico format using various different websites, not one attempt worked. Any suggestions about that please?

As far as the space goes, the 2 x Hitachi 2GB HDDs are mainly filled with video, which is then backed up onto the 2Gb Seagate Expansion drive. Clearly that is not enough backup space, so that is one problem that needs solved. Then the various other folders of images, documents, &amp; downloads get backed up onto the 500GB Seagate 'Expansion Drive' as it is named. I don't compress my data backups; I just use a program called FreeFileSync to mirror my destination directories onto my backup drives. That is because I want to be able to access all my files from my laptop using the external drives, so they are actually acting as both backup for my desktop, and external storage with a copy of all my files, for my laptop. I think that is kind of clever, but you may disagree. I back Windows OS itself up onto the Iomega HDD using *Backup and Restore (Windows 7)* as found in the Windows 7-style control panel that is also present in Windows 10. I don't use Windows 10 'back up using file history' feature as I have all my files duplicated onto external drives. I do have system protection turned on for the C-drive, and some restore points created, but not for any other drives. I'm thinking maybe I should change that though? Ultimately it seems I am going to need to get some other drive in there to provide additional backup space at the very least. There are no internal drive bays free so unless I am going to swap one or more 2GB HDD for al larger capacity drive it seems I'm going to have yet another external one cluttering up my desk. I was pondering replacing the drive inside the Iomega for a 2GB though; that should be quite an easy and cheap job.

The other problem I would like to address is having my video spread over 2 drives means that my 'video' folder in Window can only point to one location, so I have to deal with only getting the videos from A-P when I click that location, as they are split between the two drives. So I guess maybe I should merge the two drives into one in disk management, right? Are there any downsides/risks? I'm just kind of nervous about doing that because I've never had 2 physical drives merged into one logical one before and am rather fearful of data loss.

Any other pointers or suggestions would be welcome. I just generally feel I need to up my game w/r/t to storage and backup. Perhaps it's time I got into RAID, or built a NAS or file server?

Edit: the Seagate 160GB just has a Windows image that I made with Clonezilla. It's only 20GB so maybe I could move onto a USB stick, and that would clear the drive. But 160GB is clearly not going to solve the larger problem of space shortage."

10-7-2020 Remote EEG and invasive surveillance in the private / criminal sector. In contemporary technology we are faced with new dilemma and new obstacles otherwise known to be unreal or mystical.  This unfortunately challenges traditional law enforcement and modern 'burden of proof' elements.  With our criminal justice system there isn't a strong partnership between newage technology and the A.I frontier.  These sorts of 'machines' or complex code may be available only to the military or very large precincts like the NYPD 'tripwire' program.  
Its important to note that the private criminal sector has found ways to utilize these systems thru backdoors, zeroday exploits/hacks and other malware/penetration style tactics.  Some of these systems are local, federal or even international (satellites) and cell phone / data streams Data streams - EmotivPRO  and or towers.  With these systems perpetrators are able to gain exclusive access to other peoples 'real-time' data Real time, recording and playback modes - EmotivPRO .  Such as where they're located, or theyre feeling, what they look like, even as far as vital signs.  

www.neurosky.com is a example a BCI(brain to computer interface's) paired with a software and a headset for the user(s) own pleasure.  Little does neurosky know that this technology has paved the way for criminals or individuals with malicious intent to breakdown neurosky's structure and build custom invasive brain to computer interfaces.  www.OpenEEG.sourceforge.net is a community online where users can post / discuss brain scanning equipment and their latest findings. http://openeeg.sourceforge.net   Also users frequent OpenBCI - Open Source Biosensing Tools (EEG, EMG, EKG, and more).  This technology is a existential threat to not only the US but humans as a whole. Espionage is what the US intelligence community needs to be particularly afraid of, thoughts, dreams and emotions can be scanned or stored in a 'Neural Bank' thru the interception of  TCP/IP neural packets . https://packetstormsecurity.com (good source for everything related)   BrainBay OpenBCI Documentation  

Thru the use of a BCI headset a user can remotely send customized neural packets thru a neural packet receiver/sender (same-thing) to a target resulting in a phenomenon called 'synthetic telepathy'... or synthetic Insight Brainwear 5 Channel Wireless EEG Headset | EMOTIV     The headset itself doesn't support malicious software / code.  But it can be used as a vessel for perpetrators to send and receive neural packets using their own mind with the support of a BCI.   Here is a partnership between facebook and a BCI company called CTRL-LABS CTRL-labs - YouTube  CTRL-labs - Crunchbase Company Profile &amp; Funding  CTRL-labs   Neural Interface Technology  The powerful visual shown by CTRL-LABS shows a degree of sophistication that law enforcement increasingly has trouble keeping up with. But due to some brave journalists and dedicated minds we now can connect the dots and hopefully create regulations and a code of ethics regarding invasive BCI's. Unfortunately modern legal precedent is functional unaware of such activity, or at least our system isn't primed for it yet. I am writing this as a cautionary tale to those worried about new age technology and surveillance in contemporary America.  For the most part the NSA has used their collection of data ethically. But their software and tools were leaked onto the internet and scooped up by the private criminal sector.  
Regular Americans stand helpless against such technology , their information and feelings are being mined and stored by criminals for sadistic and fiscal reasons.  Such as stalking, harassment, espionage and much else.  I want to switch gears to the science and literal meaning of EEG equipment , R. Douglas Fields PhD wrote a great book on the history and creation of brain monitoring and scanning. (insert 'Electric brain references and quotes here). Also here is a hour long visual representation by Dr. R. Douglas Fields  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJtoW8wvgXo Digital Signal collection / interpretation is a process in which signals coming from send/receiving devices such as micro controllers, cell phone towers, satellites creates a full spectrum grid of surveillance that victims cannot typically break free from.  Neural nets are another component of the equation, the collection of TCP/IP neural packets go thru one of many systems one of which is a neural net.  The neural net is a system in which raw neural packets are passed thru a series of checkpoints and other mathematical formalities that process raw neural data and deliver it into a neat package for the user to see what a target or user is thinking, feeling or even dreaming...   

Legal precedent has been a issue with this technology as it is quite hard to prove.  But not impossible. If you follow the links provided and watch the visuals you will see that the technology is completely possible.  It is done thru low band frequencies usually in the 40-60 hertz range. 40-60 hertz is related to EMF (electromagnetic field) , if tuned correctly with AI, software like Brainwave it allows for a 'perp' to create  synthetic telepathy  (insert information here about synthetic telepathy). Perps in modern times are now using complex technology to target individuals and its virtually undetectable.  With the help of law enforcement and transparency thru the private sector creating a partnership is paramount to help victims , as they're always gaslighted or told they re insane.  I have been doing research on the subject for about 6 months or so and it is very very plausible due to the integration of 4g - 5g technology.   5g will revolutionize this harassment and intrusion of civil liberties to a level that we will not be able to keep up with.   
It is paramount we create ethics , regulations and arrest those who are using this for malicious intent.  Brainbay is BCI like software used thru a webcam, thru retina and facial expressions it can cross platform with narrow A.I to create synthetic EEG like imaging.   http://www.shifz.org/brainbay/  
Usually 'perps' will use a different country than the target to circumvent accountability.  Also the use of VPNS people are able to mask their location, though that technology is becoming easier to detect.  Sector, Elon Musk is developing a cranial implant called the neuralink . The neurolink is about the size of post it note , maybe a little smaller. It is intended to be symbiotic relationship between A.I and humanity.  This has promising prognosis's but major shortcomings and concerns regarding ethics and potential existential risks regarding the major evolutionary jump. Now that is out in the open and for users to use and manipulate the open source community of BCI's it is particularly troubling. The lack of oversight and the compounded interest of technology paired with exponential growth its making virtually impossible for local or even state police departments to keep up with.  All things considered its important to create a new legal framework and/or procedure when dealing with complex harassment and or remote neuro monitoring equipment (such as long range acoustic devices and or satellite installations). Users discuss innovative ideas, schematics and DIY EEG equipment for their imaging needs. The problem is the lack of oversight - due to the rapid growth of new age tech and micro controllers... paired with 5g.  It will be a serious issue for local and state authorities to keep up.  

That being said I think its paramount to establish strong legal precedent and not write this off as  hocus-pocus  or out of the realm of possibilities. Most victims present in a way that is hard to understand or comprehend for most Officers or other officials.  As its highly specialized  field of computing , neurology and networking all in one.    
EXAMPLES OF BCI's:

https://www.emotiv.com/our-technology/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJtoW8wvgXo 

There is also another community I want to state for this report, which is the www.openbci.com community.  Now this is the software component that links the brain to whichever EEG the user is using.  There is detailed images on the website showing users making custom BCI headpieces and headsets...  Most of it is DYI manuals ; users have found ways to make affordable hardware and easy to read/obtain schematics. Thru the use of TCP/IP neural packets , signals between machine to brain (VOICE TO SKULL).  This raises considerable alarms , basically this technology / software is capable of remote messages to the brain using a neural packet sender/receiver. This can be amplified for remote or wider range transmissions , or for high power localized EEG s.   Right now the standard hertz used is between 35-45 (approx, depending on the EEG s).  Perpetrators mine data thru narrow A.I and Brainbay. Unfortunately this technology is very clandestine and used in sophisticated identity theft, stalking, harassment, ransomware, blackmail, fraud , interception/espionage, privacy violations and revenge porn.  

That being said, staying many steps ahead is the key to countering the criminal aspects of this technology.  So in order to do that what was once darkness and is now out in the light, all sectors of society must be aware of the capabilities and danger associated with intrusive sophisticated unwarranted surveillance , via cross device , via cross platform/OS penetration. Thanks for spending some of your time reading my report on contemporary surveillance and the Era of A.I.  Take care, be well. Thru the use of existing code and narrow minded AI , perpetrator's  can break down existing brain to computer interfaces and use invasive technology and send and receive thoughts, and even read vital signs.  

Very few companies are capable of such feats in fact its considered cutting edge to a point, the data mining is in the most comprehensive part of the equation.  Then A.I does the rest: malware such as 'ROOTKIT's” ,   rootkits hide in the firmware of the device (PC , SMART PHONE , even wired or wireless devices).  Perpetrator's can then have a remote copy of a victim's device , this can be plugged into a BCI which can measure emotions, pupil dilation, some vital signs and other mannerisms thru what you search, type, look like (front/back facing camera).  To make matters worse if the victim has a smart watch which is bluetoothed to a rootkitted device then they have vital signs, blood pressure, steps, location and other intrusive details.  It can take many years of rootkitting in order to create a “link” to a victims cortex/brain .  

Then A.I takes over , it can take the mined data and essentially predict the victims behavior and or personality.  Again as previously stated our legal system is not yet primed to such activity, only in the intelligence sector would there be precedent. Now that 5G is being rolled out it will make the rootkit mining seemless , 5g is 600-1000x faster than 4gLTE and 30-50x faster than Wi-Fi.  So collection of data can be stored, collected and mined at a rate never ever seen before.  This would be a existential threat to national security, personal security and the mental health of the entire planet.  If we do not establish cheap detection or mute features than our fate is virtually sealed.  Sophisticated organized crime or “cabals” could use this for unbelievable potential, it would be the most power weapon known to mankind 10 fold.  I digress:  So the headpieces, headsets and brain to computer interfaces already  exist but the 
firewalls do NOT exist.  

This would be a particular issue with the military and politics.  Not only would “perps” be able to send and receive TCP/IP neural packets and other intrusive forms of neural network related forms of PERP to VICTIM communication.   In layman's, they could send voices and essentially predict and analyze your brain.  Not only that they can plug your subconscious and their dreams/dream cycle.  What else is particularly troubling is that the signal would be so strong at 5g levels it potentially alter human physiology; it has been theorized that it can prevent the oxidation of cells.  This is in theory as human physiology and 5G / intrusive EEG's brain scanning equipment is generally hidden and black listed on search engines and YouTube.  Law enforcement needs to have state, local and federal safeguards created , in conjunction with the private sector. 
 
In conjunction 'perps' can use ADOBE VOCO to impersonate the victims voice to cause further disruption to their lives  we live in the age of disinformation and fraud.  An there is almost nothing average or even high class people can do.   This is a on going report and any information that can be shed on this topic would be of much help."

First thing I noticed after installing it was that the laptop fan was running, which it rarely ever did before. Now it spun for a long time. I thought maybe I overlooked some settings, drivers or whatnot. But after updating everything, checking BIOS settings and power mode, it's still not as quiet as it used to be. So I googled around a bit, and found that heat is indeed an issue with these things. And that maybe it gets worse the bigger the capacity.

I don't really *need* the space or the performance (it was already plenty fast), so I'm considering returning the Kingston  and going stock. But are there other brands to consider, that would be better, or is it a capacity/speed issue? Do SATAs tend to run colder than NVMes?"

In both computer science and economics, efficiency is a cherished property. In computer science, the field of algorithms is almost solely focused on their efficiency. In economics, the main advantage of the free market is that it promises ""economic efficiency."" A major lesson from COVID-19 is that both fields have over-emphasized efficiency and under-emphasized resilience. In this talk, Prof. Vardi argues that resilience is a more important property than efficiency and discusses how the two fields can broaden their focus to make resilience a primary consideration

IT'S ADOBE. ok i said it, i'm talking about adobe softwares. you already knew i was talking about them. adobe softwares, but not only adobe. all those old softwares that are still extremely useful today but haven't been updated for years.

so these softwares will always be using 100% of cpu instead of running at 13 or 21% max just because they're exploiting one single core. so instead of adobe animate taking 2 minutes to render an 8 seconds animation, it will be over in 10 seconds because animate will think my i78700 is made of one core instead of 12.

same for after effects after 2014 when they removed multiple frames render.

I've capped the FPS to 30 and play with graphics, character, environment and effects quality on the LOW settings and shadows off. Honestly, I've never experienced any major problems by playing LoL like this, but now I would like to ""upgrade"", to maybe a laptop that could easily run LoL at 60 FPS and allow me to have graphic setting at high settings. 

On this laptop, whenever I tried to install ""heavier"" games I always noticed that my computer struggles to handle things and it significantly overheats, lags and takes a long to to open/load/close the game (I've recently downloaded a game called ""Drug dealer simulator"" and had an awful experience running it on my computer, even on the lowest settings possible)

I'm a university student so I don't have a massive budget and I'm looking to buy a laptop for daily use (like uni assignment, zoom calls, watching Netflix/YouTube and playing LoL + few other games) within £850 - £950/$1100 - $1200 (could stretch to £1000 for a really good/tempting one).

So what I'm really asking here is:

- What are some specs that are ""must have""s in order to run LoL with a minimum of 60 FPS and high graphic setting?
- Any laptops that you could recommend me?
- Any brands that you recommend over other?
- or any tips and comments that you think could help me make a decision

In this case, can I merely plug the SSD in because the motherboard supports UEFI?

If not, do I need to reinstall as UEFI?

Can I just reinstall windows onto the SSD from the first place, and then later use my now hard drive as a secondary?

I've seen some other forums on this and it appears it is impossible to track screen recording in general. Out of my own curiosity I've tested this on dummy videos I've uploaded and Xbox game bar in particular gives a detailed name and title of the web page being recorded, so not sure if it's only recording the screen or interacting further with the browser which can flag up if the videos are being screen recorded ?

I believe it was genuinely reconditioned as it was very clean inside when I received it.

Anyway, for the past year I just ran it with one of my two (2TB) HDDs balanced in the drive bay in a very precarious fashion which I won't even detail, out of sheer embarrassment. But it's really no good, and I've had to remove the drive for the time being while I try to work out how to do it properly.

~~[Pic of the inside of the case](https://i.imgur.com/Pzirgnn.jpg)~~

(The blue SATA cable was previously connected to the drive I've now removed). 

Is there a metal plate or something I can use to fit the drive into the lower drive bay? Failing that I suppose I'm going to need a 5.25"" to 3.5"" bay converter, but hopefully it can be done using the lower bay somehow? TIA.

Edit: I would seriously consider rebuilding the whole PC in a better case if necessary. I could happily live without the DVD-RW, and have 3 x 3.5"" HDDs + 1 x 2.5"" SSD instead.

But yet again, the top solution provided was to buy a caddy, presumably to go in a 5.25"" bay. I think I shall just go the same way. Crazy that Dell ship all these PCs out with an empty bay, but no rails to make use of them! :|"

The  PC is using a microsoft wireless keyboard and mouse; the speakers are  connected with a 3.5mm jack and the headphones are USB, connected via a  USB hub which is also connecting various other things, mainly for  charging).

There are two monitors  connected to the PC, one is plugged into the HDMI-A out (and the plug  into the monitor is DVI) and the other is connected to the DVI out (and  the plug into the monitor is DVI-D - this monitor also has two USB  sockets).

The video out for the  laptop is HDMI-A and the laptop has two USB sockets.  I would like the  laptop to be able to drive both monitors.

Finally, a webcam is connected to the PC, and I would like both the laptop and the PC to be able to use it.

I have  Lilliput PC-765 All-In-One PC Monitor with Windows CE 6.0 and i use third party custom Autorun software with this monitor.

I don't know why but when i start this monitor on, it's getting stucked on loading screen. I have Recovery SD Card for this device with NK.bin so that i can reinstall WinCE on this device, but if i do so it will Hard Reset and all the third party files will be gone.

Is there a way i can return to WinCE Interface or just boot WinCE with sd card or somehow access files on Flash Disk before Hard Resetting the Device?

I tried many things: using USB to USB cable to let PC see this as Hard Drive, using Ethernet Cable, Pressing Reset Button, also did the same thing using Windows XP SP2, Removing and inserting CMOS battery, combinations of buttons to get boot menu or developer menu (pressing and holding Power Button, pressing and holding other buttons plus mixing them etc..).

Now i came up with an idea, if i could install whole WinCE 6.0 on SD Card and just inserted it in monitor i think i would be able to access files after that.  


So can someone help me on how to install WinCE 6.0 on SD Card so i can just simply boot whole OS from SD Card thus not deleting any of the files from monitor's internal drive?

I would really like to hear what other think about this. Let say we are a group that didn't do much analysis until now, I am trying to dedicate 50% of my time to analysis and we will have a data scientist starting early next year doing the same kind of things.

So in this context, working with 1-5 TB of data (climate data/satellite imagery etc...).  Some of these analysis could be done on a small sandbox 8-16 cores 32-64GB Ram should do. While bigger analysis would require &gt; 128GB of Ram and at least 32 cores.

What would you do, buy workstation, buy local servers, move everything to the cloud... 

Here are the few options I see : 

**Option 1 :**

Get a workstation that is beefy enough to handle the pre-processing/testing and move the bigger analysis to the cloud. 

**Option 2 :**

Get a laptop and fund a processing server/sandbox for the group, that way other coworkers can access it And still process the big stuff on the cloud.

**Option 3 :**

Get a laptop and do the pre-processing/testing on cheaper cloud machines before launching the full analysis.

Any other/more clever options out there? Anything I am missing?"

224,computing,Is this the only point of building a PC with x570 or B550 right now? (August 2020),"I'm a first time builder with minimal knowledge, so if the following is wrong then by all means, let me know:


- B550 and X570 use the AM4 socket.

- B550 and X570 allow for PCie 4, but this won't be needed for graphics cards for quite some time. PCie 3 is still more than capable of handling even a 2080 TI.

- The next generation of AMD CPUs is Ryzen 4000. After Ryzen 4000, the following generation of AMD CPUs (presumably Ryzen 5000) will use a new socket (presumably AM5), as their 5 year promise of supporting the AM4 socket will have expired.

- Therefore B550 and X570 are only good for one more generation of CPUs, Ryzen 4000.

- While it's confirmed now that B450 and X470 will work with Ryzen 4000, (as AMD changed their minds on this), in order to take full advantage of all the new features of Ryzen 4000 you will need a B550 or X570 board.

- So if you have to build a PC right now (early August 2020), the only reasons to choose B550 or X570 is because:

1. You're interested in upgrading your chosen CPU (presumably 3rd gen Ryzen) the very next generation, i.e. Ryzen 4000

2. You want to take full advantage of all the new features of Ryzen 4000.

- If you have to build a PC right now but you're happy enough with your chosen Ryzen 3000 CPU, and you're not interested in Ryzen 4000, then there's no point in choosing a B550 or X570 motherboard, because:

1. B450 is less expensive and runs Ryzen 3000 just fine

2. You're not interested in upgrading to Ryzen 4000, and B550 and X570 won't allow you to upgrade your CPU past Ryzen 4000 anyway.


So is this correct guys? Again, if wrong please let me know. Thanks."

What does this mean in practice?

I also know there are more expensive splitters which will feed 2 or more monitors at 60hz each.

LG no speakers and has AMD Freesync  (2 year warranty)

As you can see on the Philips monitor specs it is 30 - 83Hz  (it should say Hz not kHz)

So 30Hz is the lowest this monitor will go  

Will the monitors work at such a low frequency? 
Will I be able to see any deterioration at 30Hz compared to 60Hz for the tasks below?  

* Normal office work dual monitor
* watch films on dual monitor
* playing less system-demanding games like Fortnight (?).  

**My main concern is will it work as dual - office work @ 30Hz?** spread sheets, word docs, citrix based apps and intranet pages.

Yesterday the USB ports stopped working because of a power surge, and so I purchased a USB PCIE hub and a few fans today. 

The problem is after dusting the pc and installing the usb hub and fans, the pc now shuts down 30 seconds after turning on, turning on 3 seconds later, and the cycle keeps going on and on. I had just recently reapplied thermal paste hoping that thermals were the source of the issue but the issues are still happening. 

One very big issue is that the usb headers on the case don't work, and I need to install drivers for the usb hub as well (assuming it works), so I currently don't have any useable usb ports. The computer is still shutting off and on despite having unplugged the pcie and fans to see if they were problematic. Please Help.

271,computing,GPU stopped working since latest nvidia drivers,"Hey everybody,

I recently installed the latest nvidia drivers (v451.67) on my gtx 650 ti boost and while it was beeing installed it stopped beeing recognized by the monitor and since then i did not have any video output. When the GPU stopped giving video output I waited like 30 minutes so the update could easily finish and after that i restarted the pc with alt + F4 and enter. But when I turn on my computer now i still don't get any video output. It is probably important to mention that I always had problems with this graphics card. It does not show the boot up screen and because of that I also do not have video output in BIOS. But when windows boots the GPU always gave video output. But now I'm not really sure at all if all these problems are related to the graphics card because my monitor is kind of old too. It is an old BenQ 1080p which has no HDMI in and is connected to the GPU via DVI.

Has someone an idea which could help in this situation. Or does some of you know a quick fix for graphics card driver related issues."

According to the [manufacturer specifications](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-compaq-dc5850-small-form-factor-pc/3658106/document/c01587146#AbT1), the top CPU supported by this system is:  

- **AMD Phenom Quad-Core Processors with HyperTransport Technology**  
  AMD Phenom X4 9600B Processor (2.3 GHz, 2 MB Dedicated L2 cache, 2 MB Shared L3 cache, HT bus 3.0)

After some googling, I've easily found several possible Phenom X4 CPUs candidates:

- [AMD Phenom HD960BWCJ4BGH](https://imgur.com/RD0MrGY)
- [AMD Phenom HD9600WCJ4BD](https://imgur.com/MB0DWZl)

- [AMD Phenom HD9550WCJ4BH](https://imgur.com/5Avw50k)
- ... etc ...

However, only the first one seems to be an exact match with the manufacture description. All the others have slight variations (ex: 9600 or 9650 instead of 9600B) which I'm not sure would be compatible with the current system.
This is somewhat unpleasant: would be nice to have more options.

&amp;nbsp;

**Questions**  
1. Indeed only the first CPU in the above list would work with the aforementioned system?  
2. Is this system really bound to this exact Phenom X4 9600B CPU? Or are there any other Phenom options?  
3. What information must be checked in order to be **SURE** that the new CPU is supported by the system?"

3 main reasons why web app performance is more important than ever:

1. Users expect apps to run seamlessly.
2. One bad experience can affect a company's reputation. 
3. Slow and unreliable web applications = higher resource consumption, which can lead to higher costs and diminished profits.

With the amount of data being shared, used, and processed, these shortcomings can be avoided through cloud optimization.

I'm buying a work laptop on my employer's tab. I can spend up to $1450 USD. Whatever I buy is mine and whatever is leftover I receive in cash. So, I want bang for my buck. My employer has a relationship with Dell (i.e. moderate discount from retail) but I can buy whatever I want.

I use some professional software but nothing too intensive. Sometimes, I run stat analyses in Excel. Most of the time, I have about 5 pdfs or word docs open and about a dozen Chrome tabs open. I'm a heavy multi-tasker but mostly for light operations. E.g. reading articles, email, streaming videos, writing Word docs, and some other business tasks. No photo or video editing or gaming of any sort (I'm a console guy).

My major concern is durability. I travel a lot and am clumsy as hell. I need something that will last -- especially in the hinges.

Right now, I'm stuck between:

(1) an XPS 13, 10th gen i7, 8gb RAM, 256 ssd for 1300 USD; and

(2) a Latitude 5310, 10th gen i7, 16gb RAM, 512 ssd for 1195.

Dell is offering more steep discounts (relative to retail) on the Latitude series.

If this isn't a thing, are there security constraints, inherent BIOS limitations, or something else that prevents this from being a thing in the future? 

Finally, if this isn't something that's currently supported by any configuration, does anyone have a workflow that best simulates this?

350,computing,Computing,"**Computing** is any activity that uses computers to manage, process, and communicate information. It includes development of both hardware and software. Computing is a critical, integral component of modern industrial technology. Major computing disciplines include computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology.

""In a general way, we can define computing to mean any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computers. Thus, computing includes designing and building hardware and software systems for a wide range of purposes; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific studies using computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; creating and using communications and entertainment media; finding and gathering information relevant to any particular purpose, and so on. The list is virtually endless, and the possibilities are vast.""

*Computing also has other meanings that are more specific, based on the context in which the term is used. For example, an information systems specialist will view computing somewhat differently from a software engineer. Regardless of the context, doing computing well can be complicated and difficult. Because society needs people to do computing well, we must think of computing not only as a profession but also as a discipline.*

360,computing,"Is there high level, open source software for quantum computing?","This is a field where my ignorance is close to total.

I used to program in assembly language, but eventually I learned C, and joined what passed for the mainstream at the time, even writing software in the artificial intelligence languages of the day. Of course I noticed that high level languages increased productivity in almost all programming situations.

Having just watched a lecture on quantum computing, one thing I took away was that programming a quantum computer on the gate or the assembly language level would be very hard. The mathematics to understand quantum logic is considerably more complex than binary logic, and much less intuitive.

High level languages get written around solving certain classes of problems, I believe Fortran was written to do math. Cobol was written to create filing systems on computers. TeX was written to do publishing at a high level of quality, and HTML was written to do publishing on the internet, with low bandwidth, low computation requirements. 

It sounded from the lecture that quantum computing has reached the point where some of the problems are well defined. Now might be the time to write a high level language, or at least to make a start at one."
361,computing,Help! Laptop's fans not working,"Hello, I'm having some trouble with my HP Spectre x360 laptop (13-ae011dx model). I bought it two years ago.

It was functioning well until I went to turn it on at a given point and it showed me a message from the BIOS that said that the coolers weren't working properly and that it was going to shut down automatically in 15 seconds unless I pressed Enter. If I did the latter, the BIOS warned that I could damage the device or lose data.

I let it shut down and I blowed hard on the holes below the computer (because that's where I think they are for ventilation) and I turned it on again, listening carefully to see if the fans started working.

When I turned it on again it showd the same message two more times and the thirs it run normally.

I downloaded hwmonitor and speedfan to check fan temperatures and speeds. They both were at 0rpm and I couldn't detect sound or air coming from the vent. The temperature was 45°C but it went up to 70°C when I opened Chome or any other program.

I then googled what to do and people recommended I updated the BIOS (which was already updated) and if that didn't work, to reset to default.

I did that (even though I had never changed the settings manually) and the fans started making sound. One of them was running at 5200rpm and the other one at hardly 60rpm. The device's temperature was at 100°C so I turned it off immediately.

I really don't know what to do. Should I open the computer up and try to clean the fan manually? Or reset everything? I can't see anything from the software because whenever I turn it on (even if it's been a day since I last turned it on) it shows me the same error and it always is at 100°C.

Hi guys,

I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me/repair a corrupted video file. I recorded a very nice clip on one of the games I was playing, but the file won't play and its corrupted. I've tried to download a few tools but they either don't work, or try to make you a stupid fee for their software when I only need to use it once, I don't have any other corrupt files. If anyone has a full version of a good video file repairer would they be able to fix it for me, or can anyone provide any other options?"

I’ve taken note in this message I received also..

“Just bear in mind that people have been editing on computers since the mid 1990's on machines that your phone massively outperforms these days.  All you really need is enough power to do the actual editing on a low resolution version, then you get a more powerful computer for as long as it takes to take all your edits and recreate them with high quality clips.  This is a ""proxy workflow"" and frankly versions of it have been used all the way back to celluloid, the purpose of the editing software is to create a text file list of edits so the master can be recreated.

What I'm saying is that literally any machine you can afford these days is enough to become an editor with.  It may not drive all the toys and you may need to add storage, but editing is a creative act more than a technical one.  You get plenty of ""all the gear, no idea"" people in the industry, but fewer who can use what they have to really tell a story, and that is the hard part.”

373,computing,"[Question for hardware experts] Spilled beer on USB Hub, still works, but questioning longevity?","Hello! Last week I had an unfortunate accident and spilled a beer on this particular hub:  [https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07MJ5CMKY/ref=ox\_sc\_mini\_detail?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A1VY95TQN9H5OG](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07MJ5CMKY/ref=ox_sc_mini_detail?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A1VY95TQN9H5OG)

It's pretty sealed, and the hub was elevated with respect to my table, so the beer spilled off quickly with a little bit going into the ports, and  I unplugged everything and shook it off as dry as I could before putting it in a bowl of rice overnight. Thankfully I didn't spill anything on my laptop or other devices.

Everything still works afterward, and I don't notice any damage to my other devices, however the hub gets warmer than I remember, and seems to also stay slightly warm for hours if I unplug my power supply but keep the hub connected to my laptop, webcam, and monitor, all with the power off which is a little strange. But again, nothing has stopped working so far.

I'd like to order another one just to be on the safe side, in case there was a short somewhere on the circuit board, but I'm curious if these things have some sort of built in short-circuit protection on the controller IC's and other parts of the circuit? Would I be wasting an order?"

Every time I get a new wireless keyboard and mouse combo, it seems like wireless mice are getting smaller and smaller. The loss of that extra inch or so causes me to switch to a ""claw grip"" and doesn't support the weight of my hand, which after many hours of working from home and casual use to stay stimulated during quarantine causes wrist strain whenever I make a claw or fist.

When I look online for new wireless keyboard and mice, it seems like the mice fall in one of two categories:

Category 1: Mouse is extremely short, has weird slopes or angles, or is extremely flat.

Category 2: Mouse is some sort of gamer mouse that looks more like a UFO than a mouse and has 4000 buttons and features that I've never used before and I'm not familiar with. While I'm open to trying some of these to alleviate wrist pain, I have no experience using these, and so I don't know what I'm looking at.

Any suggestions? Anyone have any wireless mice that they love or recommend?

1. Display scaling is apparently better on a Mac, due to its vector-based graphics, though I’ve also read conflicting info about scaling up third-party programs. 
2. Legal, easy access to all three major operating systems via virtualization or Boot Camp makes it essential for game development, to ensure that the game is compatible with all three.

Are those two points correct, is there something I’m missing that makes PC’s just as good of an option regarding those two issues? I would appreciate an unbiased discussion if possible."

429,computing,The CPU on my laptop is completely fried - if this is replaced will the laptop be the same as it was before it failed?,"Hi, 

So I bought a Dell XPS 15 2 in 1 16 months ago and over a week ago the CPU failed. A local repair shop collected it and said that the processor had been completely burnt out. This is of course horrendous and totally unacceptable for a laptop of that price and spec, but that's another story!

My question is: if the processor is replaced, will the laptop be the same as how it was before the processor failed? Most notably, if the laptop processor is fixed and I turn the laptop on will it be as if nothing has happened and I can just pick up with all my files where I left off or will the processor failing have caused data loss?

I managed to recover some of the files from the SSD but there are some gaming/KeepNote files that will be lost forever unless changing the processor fixes the laptop completely.

Please help!"

Hello, I need help with diagnosing what component is broken:

3 nights ago my pc just made a popping noise and tripped the house's fuse/breaker for the top floor (20a fuse). After resseting found that pc would not turn on (regretfully, surge protector not used, assumed it was built into house's breaker board, duh).

After checking it was found the PSU does not make any noise when turned on (transistor ping ect) This was replaced and now it turns on (hear a ping noise every time switched on) but still no motherboard lights. I tried to hard reset all the old and new psu + motherboard and still no lights or fan. Also tried CMOS reset on motherboard and did not work after reset. Also tested all plugs and they're all in tight and none of the connectors show sign of overheating/explosion (work in auto industry, have rough idea of a dead connector appearance).


Do not own a voltmeter, is there any way I can diagnose specifically what broke (whether its just a motherboard, or CPU aswell), or do I just have to bite the bullet and get em shipped anyways. 


Many thanks,

439,computing,"I have $750 to build a sweet, sweet rig. Suggestions?","Just recently, my sis-in-law jumped into video editing to help out our local church with streaming and such. While they've given her a decent laptop (16gb of high-end RAM, a not-terrible 3.4 ghz quad core, etc.), the thing unsurprisingly heats up and eventually stutters near the end of every editing gig.

My SIL is decent at taking in new programs, but hardware language makes her throw her arms up in despair. So I checked out her desktop to see about upgrading...and found a woefully unprepared 2010 Lenovo ThinkStation E20. (It had 8gb of DDR3 RAM in it though, which was kinda cool to see.) While a decent office tank in its own right, it's no Big-Rig, and along with editing she has two kids and a decent knowledge of Steam games for them to grow into for the foreseeable future. So I suggested she start from scratch and upgrade for real. I expected a budget-level response (i.e. 2 or 3 hun at most - which I could at least help out with and cobble *something* together, maybe as an early b-day thing?) but she said she'd been saving, and gave me $750 to go wild with. She also has a newly-purchased Radeon RX-580 GPU standing at the ready for whatever rig we end up with.

Thoughts on how to turn $750 and a middling-to-fair GPU into a sleek, beautiful jungle beast that glides through the forest in silence after its unsuspecting digital prey by the ray-tracing light of the moon? ...or something kinda like it. Ngl, it's like Christmas morning here. :D

Tl,dr; I have $750 and a decent graphics card to make into as great a PC as I can. Building it from scratch is usually my go-to, but if an existing deal on a rig pops, that's certainly acceptable, considering it might speed things up a bit for her. PC redditors, assemble!"

The key thing is to have stuff organized using a simple yet thorough system that I can easily implement across drives and through updates/repairs/replacements.

It will likely be replaced with a laptop.  However, I'd like to use/access the 3 drives that are in the PC - a 500GB SSD, a 1TB HDD, and a BD-R drive (I backed up a bunch of old photography and college stuff on BD-RE discs). 

Is there a such thing as an external enclosure that can contain all 3 of these drives?  Some sort of mini-sever thing?  Something standalone driven by a NUC would work.  Willing to get creative...

It would be *preferable* if the solution would play well with both Windows and OSx, but Windows-only is workable.

484,computing,R9 280x causing second monitor to flicker.,"So basically i have a MSI R9 280x, and when i try to overclock it by even 1 mhz my second monitor starts flickering. Now i know people are going to say that the clock is unstable, but it's not. When i only have 1 monitor plugged in, no flickering occurs and i can enjoy the performance increase. I have isolated the issue to being that it only happens when the GPU is idle, as the second monitor only flickers when my gpu speed is at 300mhz, any higher than that and the flickering goes away.  And if i launch an intensive game the gpu runs overclocked just fine.

Is there any solutions to this? Maybe a way to force the GPU to run at a higher clock speed even when idle? Thanks"

Doesn't matter whether it's all through a DLL, commands over a serial port, or anything else that allows automation  -- once I can interface with it one way or other via my own software, all's good. Price is no object, so I'd prefer something super robust over a ""hobbyist"" type device. Doesn't matter what interface the device connects to PC with.

508,computing,"The hardware interface of a computer defines what it can do at all and this seems obvious, but is actually suprisingly more deep then initially appearent by typical household types.","At home in usual life we have roughly 3 types of computer hardware interface that most are familiar with. 

A hardware interface is a term i defined here for its lacking existence due to few examples of it. It means the substance building up the computer and its programs which represent the interface of functions. 

In usual life only three exist around us, they are the cellphone, Personal computer and television and each is different because they use a different interface and hardware.

These examples only provided me with an initial insight on the fact that a hardware interface allows a subset of utilities that only its subset allows. This with two other historical examples showed me that the difference is actually very important and useful. 

The other two less familiar are the original and larger computer models built initially for scientific and military purposes. These were initial when computers began and were far far larger and fit in the sams class of computer as the large hadron collider and industry scale machines for production.

The only other example is the farthest found at all and is the analytical engine made by charles babbage in the 1800's that was his project and provided a subset of calculations convenient for him at the time and what he spent time studying. 

Its the most complex form of computer lacking electricity besides abacuses and a puppet powered by gears that wrote letters also from around the 1800s. 

All of these examples provide distinct possible ends of purpose and only because they each have different hardware and interfaces for allowing something that the others can't based off what the materials provide.

Thus with these examples I became preoccupied with trying to define another of these computer hardware interfaces to see what else could be done with them. I did this initially as a humorous joke because I dont even know how to make a normal computer only code them. 

I also use computer code as a form of modelling like math as my usual hobby and in summary its useful for a different subset of physical reality then the atom. This math is specified and useful for pattern scale macroscale matter people see instead of its components. I use it to study patterns of visual information and discover uses for them. 

It is mathematical and has operators so when I started making inventions after a while of only observation and recording of the pattern scale matter I studied I used the math to experiement with it. 

Eventually I built up and understanding of what I was studying and found a previously shown method of encoding equations as patterns of visual information depicting outputs. This then continued with my excitement of its usefulness as a form of calculation and led to tje completed computer hardware interface I can now use for my other studies.

Its different from typical computing however because it is defined as subcomputing for being subtextual. It is a non-electrical hardware program space of mentally processed encoded references. 

It is a type of computing that exists through a seperation of mind and matter in interaction of interput data allowing spatially existent emulations. Its interput because output and input are identical in this case.

Its physical based programs of encoded information is different from the norm because in the usual programs exist in an isolated location as the computer. In subcomputers the program is an isolated object used at need and repeats when accessed in a space of stored programs that interact through the user using them in seperation.  

But its most unique in the difference of physical emulations compared to virtual emulations since the difference allows me to construct visual still shapes of a self defined geometry and pattern. 

The previous project was focused on paper and recyclable materials so subcomputing allows a method for creating artificial visual subsets of any geometry and pattern desired as appearence models of anything imagineable. 

Thus the programs represent encoded meaning with appearences that become visual structures composed of what is encoded. So it lets me create artificial realities of material rescources constrained to the artificially paper specific values. Meaning I can use it as a form artificial world of specifically forming matter that is anything encoded.

As a result similar to a normal computer it can make videogames of other realities, but in this case it can't animate the behaviors only create a model appearence of the scenery, that can be used as real material to create the real effect by assigning the appearence to the actual behavior. 

As a result the programs which represent a program of data as an array of information operated displayed visually can give me access to subsets of surreal matter that lets me do virtually and in artificial sense anything in appearences alone, without consequence to anything but paper itself. 

Its a subreal emulation of any made up substance, but built physically as effects built of a light material appearence that can do anything you figure out how to manipulate with the paper. Although technically its designed for multiverse travel since it lets me emulate any reality visually as what the patterns of the world would be. 

Its a computer because it equally allows calculation and emulation within a hardware interface of constrained class functions, but this example is a hardware of paper and mind encoded mathematically as classes of objects performing tasks of pattern interpreted activity. 

Not sure what it can do beyond make artificial rescource textures for conventional invention or appearence. The concept also allows animation using flip books or real motion although I am still researching how to do that without electricity since thats a fire hazard. Its possible cause my body doesnt need a plug you see. 

I find it fascinating and I'm using it for immersion while exploring parrelel lines of philosophy and world."

568,computing,Options for hooking an (as-yet un-purchased) laptop up to my PC?,"So I've been thinking about getting a laptop in addition to my windows 10 [Dell Vostro 460 PC](https://www.dell.com/en-uk/work/shop/desktop-and-all-in-one-pcs/vostro-460-mini-tower/spd/vostro-460) lately. One of the main things I would like to do with it is hook it up to the PC so I can have an extended display. That would really be helpful for studying and other tasks as it's great to be able to be able to have two programs visible simultaneously, for instance I often like to have my web browser or some document that I'm referring to open on the right-hand display, and whatever program I'm working with on the left. NB I'm not into games, video production, graphic design, or anything like that, so I don't need state-of-the-art graphics by any means.

I was having a bit of a look at laptops on my rather meagre budget today and thinking I might go for an HP Elitebook with an SSD and maybe 8GB RAM and either i5 or i7 Core processor. I've used one before quite a bit as we had them supplied at college, and IMO they are quite nice-looking and neat little laptops, as well as having pretty good performance as far as I can tell. I'm open to any feedback about that though. It looks like I should be able to get one second-hand for about £100 which is within my budget. I don't really want to spend a lot as it's only going to get light use, as a secondary device to my PC, and besides, I'm saving to buy a flat right now.

So, what I want to know is, what's the best way to go about hooking them up to extend the display? I was reading [this guide for a wireless route](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/UseASecondLaptopAsAnExtendedMonitorWithWindows10WirelessDisplays.aspx), but my PC doesn't have that 'connect to a wireless display', presumably because my PC has no wireless capability, only my router does. I think I do have a cheap USB wireless dongle somewhere that I bought a while back and was wondering about digging that out and seeing if I could do it that way.

But maybe a better option would be to use the [AMD Radeon HD 6450](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-hd-6450.c402) that came with my PC? I'm only using the VGA adaptor so the DVI and HDMI ports would available to take an output to any laptop I buy. But not every laptop is going to have these connectors by any means, I'm sure. I was reading for instance [here](https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/No-HDMI-port/td-p/6315816) and wondering if the eventual solution is going to be some kind of [USB C to HDMI Adapter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/uni-Adapter-Discount-Compatible-MacBook/dp/B075V68NVR)? 

Oof, I just really don't know how to approach this. I suppose I'm just going to need to 'bite the bullet' and buy a laptop first, then take it from there, but it would be nice if I had a concrete plan for how this dual display is going to work *before* I splash the cash for a laptop. Any advice please? TIA.

Edit: I wonder if I got the HP Elitebook, I might have to get this [HP DisplayPort to HDMI 1.4 Adapter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/HP-DisplayPort-HDMI-1-4-Adapter/dp/B00H37FY8Q)? Does HP seriously have their own proprietary display adaptor? That kind of puts me off, and I worry if it would even necessarily work with the AMD Radeon card.

Mobo  AsRock A320M-HDV   //  Ryzen 5 3400G  // DDR4 2666 8GB Ram single stick // 500 Gb M2 Drive //

It had been working perfectly until a week ago. When I pressed the Power button (on the case) in the morning, the computer would not react at all: no lights, no fans, nothing.

I kept pressing the button several times until the computer started. It booted up normally, and worked perfectly during the day.

Next day the same: unresponsive button. A light smack on the PSU, and the computer reacted. I turned it off and on several times, and the button worked fine.

On the third day, I cheched all the connections on the motherboard before powering it up. All seemed fine, but had to press the button like 20 times until it started. Again, once the Pc has booted in the morning, I can turn it off and on without problem. This was friday. I decided to let the computer on so I could work Saturday and Sunday.

On Monday, I took the computer to the store to have it checked. Today (Wednesday) I got it back and it has been working fine, and I hope it will keep like that.

However, what baffles me, is the explanation I got from the guy at the store: an incompatible RAM stick was causing that problem (a problem that started to show up after  4 months of daily usage).  
Could this be true?

Theres a setting that switches off entire channels if that isnt the cause either. Any ideas? CPU is i7 6400 unlocked, and Corsair HX1000i with additional eatx plug added

600,computing,Seagate HDD infected or dead?,"Ok, so firstly yes I'm an idiot for plugging a system drive into another pc (same brand/architecture) which my sister used... Without virus checking it her drive! (Was planning to pull her files off &amp; use it as a storage drive). After an initial successful boot (switched boot drive to mine), the HDD is no longer detectable!
I've had it back out into the old sff tower, but not detectable. Put it into an enclosure &amp; connected via USB to a laptop (redundant laptop, just in case it was virus)... But not detectable 😬 had identical drive (with exception of size) so swapped the control boards to test that, but no difference 😟😟

The laptop detected a connection (usual bleep/bong whatever it is), &amp; the drive spins, but doesn't appear in explorer.

Is it at all possible it's got a virus which is preventing it being detected (repairable?).... Or has it had a short &amp; is not repairable?

I've done lots with pcs before (upgrades to scratch builds) but will admit to being the 'have a go' type, rather than proper training &amp; reading huge books!"

Up until a couple hours ago, it worked just fine. Now it makes a constant repeating popping sound all the time. While shutting down, the popping repeats faster, but it will make the sound even while in POST, so it's not just a software issue. The only way I could silence it was to disable it in the BIOS.

Needless to say, this has been difficult to google with any useful results or I probably would have resolved it myself. Any help would be appreciated.

EDIT: The SSD is installed as a new drive, not as a replacement.

EDIT: The popping continued while the PC was shutdown, so this appears to be a hardware issue.

EDIT: Driver is the latest, bios is the latest. Headset was tested on another PC and works fine. Plugged the headset back into my PC and now instead of popping, there's just a tone and no other sound can play. I think my onboard audio is just borked."

Does anyone know of a way to convert an old digital picture frame into a DSLR camera monitor? Or at least where I can find more information or resources?

633,computing,Best laptop for cloud computing,"I use my laptop exclusively for work, for which nearly all my files and applications are cloud based. I really don't care about high speed performance or storage, because my personal computer isn't doing much other than connecting me to other resources. (Wifi is of course extremely important, but I doubt there's much to avoid due to issues with that.) I do however really care about the hardware, look and feel, and interface- not graphics, I just want as big as screen as possible, great keyboard, fairly rugged.

I really don't want to think about my computer, just use it, and enjoy all the time I have to spend on it as much as possible. Are there models that have minimal processing power (and therefore might be cheaper) but don't skimp on look and feel and display size and durability? I have a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon now.

I have ordered another 500gb SSD and planned to clone the failing drive, however, something is making a stupid amount of writes to that disc.

is there a way to see what is making suck high writes?

I would rather close than reinstall windows, as, it has been a pain sorting licenses which I found last year when I got this new SSD and decided to reinstall windows fresh, rather than the update from windows 7, although I am open to being told thats a really dumb idea!

Disconnecting/reconnecting the usb adapter or disabling/enabling the pcie adapter fixes the issue temporarily but they continue to have problems after. The one's I've tried are:

Netgear WNA3100 N300 usb adapter

TP-Link TL-WN881ND N300 pcie adapter

Don't recall the third one, it was briefly used and some sort of usb adapter

I recognize these were cheap adapters, which may be the problem, but I find it hard to believe they would all be so poor. I am wondering if it is perhaps some other hardware or software issue or something else. I have directly wired my PC with no problems, and my wireless network offers no problems with other devices on the network; the location is not an issue either as other devices in the area have no problem maintaining connection.

Anyway, I was hoping for any opinions on similar issues people have had, or suggestions on a wireless adapter that has worked for them; at this point, I'm a little hesitant on buying another if it will have the same problems. PC runs on Windows 10."

641,computing,Cheap ~250 GB 2.5 inch SATA SSD for old laptop,"Here's what I need:

Approximately 250 GB of capacity, anything between 240 and 256 GB is fine.

2.5 inch, not sure if 7mm or 9mm. Will a 7mm drive go in a 9mm bay, or do I have to be absolutely sure which thickness my bay is? If so, where do I figure it out?

My laptop only has SATA 2. I'd like to be able to satisfy that, but being faster than that doesn't matter.

I want it to be about $30 or less, and I want it to be able to last for about 2 years at the very least.

I already found some SSDs that I think fit the requirements. Are these any good, or are there better ones? In order of increasing price:

ADATA SU635 240GB (ASU635SS-240GQ-R) for $24.99

Silicon Power A55 256GB (SP256GBSS3A55S25) for $27.99

Pioneer 240GB (APS-SL3N-240) for $29.49

Addlink S20 256GB for $30.88

Pioneer 256GB (APS-SL3N-256) for $30.99

Dogfish 240GB for $31

Crucial BX500 240 GB for $31.95

ADATA SU760 256GB (ASU760SS-256GT-C) for $31.99

Kingston A400 240GB (SA400S37/240G) for $31.99

Sandisk SSD PLUS 240GB (SDSSDA-240G-G26) for $32.80

Dogfish 250GB for $33

ADATA SU800 256GB (ASU800SS-256GT-C) for $33.99

Dogfish 256GB for $35

Out of this list, I've heard that Crucial, Kingston, and Sandisk are good. I know about Pioneer making audio equipment, but I can't seem to find anything about their SSDs. ADATA and Silicon Power appear to be OK but not great, Dogfish appears to have durability issues, and I can't find anything about Addlink. Are these findings accurate?

Is it worth paying more for a 250 or 256 GB drive over a 240 GB drive? Would I just be paying to have to overprovision the drive myself? Can a drive be hacked to change the amount of overprovisioning it has?

Why are more bits per cell slower? The way I understand it is that if there are more bits per cell, you don't need to read or write as many cells, so the data should get read faster, not slower, unless each individual operation takes longer by a large enough factor to outweigh this benefit. Is that what is happening? If so, why does having more bits per cell make each operation take so much longer?

I've heard of SSDs being bricked when they suddenly lose power, but that was way back in like 2016. Is that still a problem?

I want to full disk encrypt my SSD with LUKS. Will that interfere with operations like TRIM?"

651,computing,Interested in creating a “supercomputer” or cluster,"Ive recently been wondering how to setup a cluster of computers. Its been a project of mine that i would really need. Reason being i edit 4k-8k footage everyday and need a computer powerful enough to do this well faster. I also do a lot of other calculations based experiments which usually take 8-10 hours on my main rig. 

So what do i need to have? I was thinking about building a few smaller computers with similar or identical specs. Connecting them up and i think connecting them to my host computer? I really am new to the whole idea of clusters so any help will be greatful! Thanks"

（or even better, if I can have the projector display 2-4 VR headsets simultaneously in a split screen fashion). 

How can i achieve this, and what additional hardware / apps would i need?

665,computing,New to IRC - Giving Reddit Gold/Premium for Solid Answers!,"Hi,

I’m brand new to IRC.

I’ve done some digging and found that IRC is still a pretty cool way to find new communities and people.  However, I’m a bit of a security paranoic and would like to affirm that I’m being as safe as possible.  Certain things cannot be controlled such as 0-day exploits, etc.  What I’m looking for here are best practices to mitigate unnecessary negative experiences.

By “safe”, I do NOT mean secure from surveillance.  I mean secure from anyone accessing my devices or home network in a nefarious way.  For example: a rootkit or trojan that would give access to my devices and their stored information.

I’ve searched many places for answers to my questions but couldn’t find any for some, found partial or outdated information for others, and just need extra confirmation for the rest.

Maybe you all can help and earn some reddit gold in the process.  Your time is valuable and I’ll be happy to compensate for it.

FYI: I will be using mIRC on Windows 10 and Textual 7 on macOS.  I **haven’t** downloaded them yet; I will be doing that as soon as I get the answers I need.

Questions:

#1.  Do most people run IRC clients on their actual OS?  What about a sandbox or virtual machine to run the IRC client?

Or, do you all use online in-browser services like IRCCloud or KiwiIRC?

#2.  Are there certain settings that should be immediately tweaked on the above two (mIRC/Textual 7) IRC clients?

#3.  Is it possible to completely disable another user from “pinging” (don’t really know the actual term; is it WHOIS?) your device?

I read somewhere that people can ping to figure out your OS, IRC client version, and even your IP address.  I don’t care to hide this information from admins/staff on a server - just from regular users.

#4.  Is there a setting that **automatically** enables a SSL/TLS (secure) connection to whatever server you connect to so you don’t have to edit port number settings for each server?

#5.  Is it possible to **completely** **disable** Direct-Client to-Client (DCC) for **every** user and server you join?

What I mean by this is if a user attempts to send you a file, their request is never even sent to your client.

Also, is it possible to implement this in a way that other users will **not** be able to “ping” to check your DCC settings?  I have read that people can use commands like these to see who can receive files from them or not.

#6.  Do most IRC clients allow you to **disable links** from being active?

So if someone posts a link to a website, the URL still shows but is not clickable.  Instead, it appears as plaintext and has to manually be copied and pasted in a browser.  This is to protect from accidentally clicking on a malicious link.

#7.  On mIRC, there is an option to enter your “Real Name” and “Address.”

I know it is unwise to actually enter valid data.  But what is the purpose for these fields any way?  Is this the data that other users can access when they ping you?

#8.  I am a bit confused about making accounts on IRC servers.

For example, say you’re given this IRC server URL to connect to:

Server: irc.testirc.com
Port: 6667

You join with a temporary name, let’s say “TestAcc.”  You end up enjoying the server’s community and wish to make an actual permanent account.  You follow whatever process is in place to make the account - i.e. supply a valid email and password, etc.  Then you get an email from the server staff with your password details and other account info.  Great, but... now what?

How would you join the server with your newly created account?

Do you disconnect from the server so your temporary “TestAcc” is kicked and it automatically reconnect with your new permanent account?

Or do you always initially connect on a temporary account and run some sort of command like this: - totally making this up here btw - /username “enter username” and /password “enter password” - each time to switch to your real account.

#9.  Is it possible to block any user from sending you ANY file?

From EXEs to JPGs and anything in between, is there a way to ensure that nobody can send you anything?

Is this the same thing as disabling DCC (Question #4 above)?

#10.  If a user wants to use your chosen username (username of the account you set up), they can use it for as long as they like until you log back on with your password, correct?  Then they get kicked - is this right?

If so, is there a way to stop anyone from using your name even when you’re disconnected aside from a bouncer/BNC service?

How do users verify if a person is who they say they are?

Isn’t there a significant risk if someone uses your name and fools other users by impersonating you?  Or joins a server with your name and goes wild, getting your name banned?

I’ve read certain server administration bots can actually kick/ban a user as soon as they join based on their name if it’s on a blacklist.  So if a person causes mischief using your name, you won’t be able to connect to the server with that name the next time you log on.

#11.  Forgive me for being naive but will a VPN hide your IP/location information just as well as it does in the browser?

Do IRC clients need certain settings changed for the traffic to route through VPN correctly?

We’re assuming the following of course: reputable VPN, installed and configured well, and working as expected (no VPN server glitches/issues)

#12.  I read about “scripts.”

Do these run on the server itself (meaning you can’t do anything about them - the second you join a server, if it has a script, it’ll run) or are these commands/code/files that a user needs to run on their own?

If scripts are files, then by disabling DCC, you won’t have to worry about malicious scripts, right?  No one can send you any files (including scripts) so you’re all good?

#13.  Anything else that I missed?

What other settings do you tweak to ensure maximum privacy/security?  Other IRC tips, tricks, or info?

As i understand it, despite the difficulties of building one, it is worth it to have a cluster one, at least in my country is helluva cheaper, assuming that is almost the same thing, and the possibilities of building a faster and a stronger PC with in a cluster one it is almost infinite (?)

669,computing,Predecessor of the Intel Boot Guard?,"To start off, I am not even sure if this is the right sub to ask this question, but idk where else to ask.

So about a year or so ago when the ""first"" bios-virus (now named lojax) got discovered, I was interested and started reading articles and blogs about the whole topic of malicious code in the bios. At some point, someone linked a site from an official domain of either microsoft or intel (I do not recall anymore but I know that I checked the domain) which had an old 2000s-ish look to it (almost plain text) which talked about a project of (once again either microsoft or intel or even both, sorry that I confuse these here) Microsoft which is supposed to check code as the bios starts and memories get loaded. It also had an ""interesting"" FAQ section where they talked about probable violations of ""Cartel""-stuff and monopolies on the whole thing, foreseeing the late 2010s, the site itself having timestamps from the early 2000s, probably 2003 at best.

&amp;#x200B;

G-sync it self don't ad input lag so if i have it I might as well turn it on to get stutter/screen tearing free game play. So as I understand u turn g-sync on + vsync off find the fps by caping it 165 then 164 ect where there is no screen tearing at bottom of the screen let's say it would be 158 then u go Nvidia control panel turn g-sync on vsync off set low latency to ultra and cap ur fps at 158 and this is the way u get lowest input lag + as it would be running a monitor who don't have g-sync and just caping fps at 165fps but this way u don't get the benefits as smooth game play no stuttering. This would be best only for GPU bound games like apex legends other games that use CPU this could increase input lag? Please correct me if I'm wrong or maybe I need to turn g-sync off  set fixed refresh rate null set to ultra fps cap at 165. Main game is apex legends. This I how I run the game currently.

673,computing,What is the effect of multiple CPUs when doing intensive calculations?,"Please forgive the naive questions. I've not looked into this topic before.

I rent a VPS which has one CPU. The program I use is able to test approx 400K keys per second. Since I need to check millions of keys, this isn't all that fast. The specific task is to create a ""vanity"" Bitcoin address using [https://github.com/exploitagency/vanitygen-plus/releases](https://github.com/exploitagency/vanitygen-plus/releases)

One option is to rent a VPS with more than one CPU e.g. six CPUs. Would this mean that I could average 2.4 million keys per second (400,000 \* 6)? Would all the CPUs be able to simultaneously work on the same task?

The CPUs are called ""vCPU"" as in virtual CPU. Does this matter?

Does RAM have an effect? For example, would 2 CPUs with 4GB RAM be slower than 2 CPUs with 8GB RAM?

Thanks."
