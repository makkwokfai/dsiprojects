2,datascience,Data Science is not an easy and quick job that can get things done magically fast.,"My company hired a three man team of data scientists (including me, a Jr. Data Scientist). 

They throw us dirty ass data sets which were never vetted by data engineers, just developers tossing whatever they wanted in the databases and tracking fuck all. 

Then they expect the team to do “data science-y stuff” in 2-3 days. 

They don’t understand that data scientists requires a whole fucking lot of time to talk with stakeholders, understanding what they want, understanding what’s available, and then working with data engineers to see if any of this is already available but not stored properly (clean ups etc). 

Then comes the understanding of the relations between data sets within the database, then comes the math hypothesis and then comes the experimentation. 

Visuals are a by product of that experimentation.  Coding comes into play when we construct our experiments, and when we visualise them (SQL to Tableau). 

But my fucking god. 2-3 days is fucking ridiculous. Most companies think data science teams are just an extension of the engineering arm that validates their stupid business decisions to make numbers go brrrr. 

I’ve never seen a company tell their team of data scientists to wing the numbers and try to get a target close to what’s expected just to please the board and senior management. 

B r u h I’ve been a data scientist for 2 companies now and it’s the same shit. Am I choosing the wrong companies or did I miss any memo?"
3,datascience,Summer programs for undergrads?,"I'm a sophomore in college considering a career in data science. I'm currently taking foundational stats, applied math, cs, machine learning courses. Along with applying to some internships (hard to get as a sophomore in data science), I want to apply to programs for this summer and just in general to develop/apply data science skills. I found a couple that interest me, including:

* [Correlation One Data Science For All](https://www.correlation-one.com/ds4a-empowerment)
* [diive Data Science Summer Internship/Bootcamp Program](https://www.godiive.com/bootcamps/datascience-program/)
* [Data Science For Social Good Fellowship](https://www.dssgfellowship.org/)

I would appreciate any other recommendations/links to programs I should apply to (I know many deadlines are fast approaching in December/January) as well as some general advice on how to get practical data science experience beyond coursework as a college sophomore. I feel like I'm not advanced enough to apply to big tech companies yet (got a couple of initial interviews but didn't proceed). But I want to get some experience this summer so that I'm more prepared to apply to big tech data science, quant, and fintech internships next year (for junior summer). Thank you!"
4,datascience,Undergraduate Data Science internships,"Hi everyone! I'm an undergraduate junior Applied Math/Physics double major (and CS minor) at a top 10 CS school interested in a career in Data Science/Machine Learning. As for my experience (directly related to DS/ML), I have some light projects under my belt, a Data Science internship that I completed at a fortune 50 company this past summer, and another Data Science internship for a small startup that I'm currently pursuing part-time as well (these companies both have  undergraduate data science intern programs). That being said, I've been aiming for a DS/ML internship for this upcoming summer at a high-tier tech company (maybe FAANG or a hot startup) but almost all of these companies prefer advanced degrees (which I totally understand). I do plan to pursue an MS in Stats/CS, which I assume would help me recruit for these companies when the time comes, but I was wondering what I should do until then (i.e. this upcoming summer)? I do have a return offer from the same company that I was with last summer, but I wasn't too interested in said company's industry/the data I was working with and my return offer has no significant hike in pay (which is also important to me as I'm trying to support myself financially as much as I can). I understand that I'm only an undergrad and that this field demands highly-educated candidates, but do you guys know of any companies with such undergraduate DS/ML internship programs? Or do you guys have any other advice in general (recruiting, my current route, etc.)? Any feedback would be appreciated!"
5,datascience,Is working as an analyst or DS in sustainability worth it?,"
I’m having major doubts about my career and I could use some advice. 

I have a degree in business admin and finance, experience running a small business and some analytics experience. I also participated in two international consulting projects at school (I focused on sustainability consulting). 

Now, I have the opportunity to pursue a MSc data analytics at Strathclyde, which I’ve been told is really good for gaining skills that I’d actually use at work and for industry ties. I’d like to work in sustainability, ideally as a consultant, but financial security concerns me a lot. 

For those of you who work in sustainability DS, is it worth it? What’s a regular work day like? Do you feel you’re underpaid compared to other analysts or data scientists?"
6,datascience,"At your company, do the business teams who collab with data scientists have a good understanding of commonly used business-y stats terms? When they hear ""significance"" or ""correlation,"" how do they interpret it? Any studies on interpretation of stats terms in business settings?","Anyone aware of any studies around how people without a stats background interpret statistical terms? I'm particularly interested in the interpretation by those who frequently hear/say these terms in a business setting, but who don't have a great understanding of stats.

And a related discussion question: How big is the DS communication gap at your company? Which miscommunicated words have the most severe consequences? What kind of challenges arise because of the gap?"
7,datascience,Online Masters in Statistics vs Data Science/CS/Analytics Programs?,"I currently work as a statistical modeling analyst and I've been looking into pursuing an online master's while working full time (my employer will pay up to $6K a year). I wanted to know if anyone had suggestions/experience on online master programs in statistics and how do they compare to master programs in analytics/cs/data science from a learning standpoint. 

Some background of myself, I got a degree in Physics from an R1 university and worked in an astronomy lab for 3 years during undergrad where I worked on observational astro projects - AKA a lot of data processing, model building, formal research background, etc. Coming from a physics background, I enjoy learning about the theory that drives the techniques/tools/algorithms used for data science. And on the flip side, I enjoy applying these tools as well. 

I already looked into Analytics/Computer Science programs given by the big two - GA Tech and UT Austin. GA Tech's analytics program looks pretty enticing with both an analytics tools track and computational data analytics track. UT Austin's CS and Analytics programs look alright, but if I were to choose between the two, I'd go with GA Tech. Plus UT Austin's analytics program is too new for there to be a good review of it. The biggest thing that concerns me is the rigor of these programs. I've seen mixed reviews. I understand these are made out to be for working professionals from all backgrounds, but I want to make sure they don't just scratch the surface in terms of theory. Which made me think that I should ditch these programs in general and see if there are statistics/applied statistics online programs.

I don't have any knowledge in these, but I would assume they are way more heavily math orientated though I could be wrong. In my experience (in both undergrad courses and working in my lab) between learning the theory and learning how to apply theory, the theory is harder to learn on the job (at least for me). I would like to go through a more formal learning process. Once I learn theory, applying that is something that can be learned on the job. 

Any insight or program suggestions to look into would be appreciated!"
8,datascience,Performance measure for big data (on laptop),"I'm planning to go deeper into big data - since I just invested myself in a brand new laptop (with some nice RTX GPUs, i7 core, etc.), is there any advice or tips for newbies like me to measure the performance of big data analytics?

I know I can try and install the latest Hadoop (which is huge!) and see how the laptop behaves or maybe running some large data set on a ML algo, but I am still a bit hazey on the correct approaches or strategies to run performance test on them.

Like for ML, all I did before was just putting a start and stop timer in between the algo - whether this utilised the cores or the GPUs, I'm unsure of measuring them.

Any suggestions or a place to start is welcome!"
9,datascience,Best Project Based Data Science Tutorial,"Hey all! I'd love to get recommendations on some great project based tutorials on data science for people that are trying to learn more, especially related to ones that would be used in a real work situation. I'm trying to build up my portfolio and learn more.

One recommendation I have for you is Ken Jee's step by step tutorial."
11,datascience,More senior position at a less prestigious company?,"I'm currently interviewing at another company where I am likely to get the job and a significant pay increase. I will essentially be moving from a mid level data engineering position to an engineering lead position as part of a rapidly growing data science team.

However, I am hesitant to accept the offer because my current company (fortune 500 non-technology) has a better name in the field and much more job stability during the uncertainty of a pandemic. The new job would be at another non-tech company that has no reputation for software development or data science.

At the same time, this other job is in the ideal city I have been trying to move to for almost a year. Also, I do like the job title and salary increase."
12,datascience,"When it comes to Data Science books, do you prefer physical books, digital books or Audiobooks?","Recently joined a DS book club and the first book we’re reading is [The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail--but Some Don't](https://smile.amazon.com/Signal-Noise-Many-Predictions-Fail-but/dp/0143125087/ref=sr_1_1)

I’m debating which type of book is better for learning. Due to my anxiety, audiobooks are more my thing. But, I’m not sure you can really study from an audiobook.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/k6csxc)"
13,datascience,"Is anybody familiar with the term ""coverage"" in medical data?","I have a dataset about inpatient beds at hospitals for each state and the term that pops up a lot in the columns is ""coverage"". Does anybody know what that actually means? For instance, inpatient beds used coverage. That number is lower than inpatient beds used so it has to mean something special but I can't figure out what. Google keeps referring me to insurance."
14,datascience,GIS Knowledge?,"I am currently enrolled in an MS in Data Science that offers some GIS courses. Ideally, I would like to eventually work in the environmental industry working in sustainability, environmental conservation, climate change, etc..

How important would it be to learn GIS skills?
Also, I've seen posts mentioning that data scientist positions working with GIS often offer substantially lower salaries. Is this true? I would love to hear some thoughts on the different paths from individuals currently in the industry, both GIS and non-GIS positions."
16,datascience,Looking for a data set,I am looking for a data set related to education for a class. Something with a binary output (like will a given student graduate HS) and not to many input parameters. Wondered if anyone has any suggestions!
17,datascience,Is this laptop suitable for a data science degree?,"I'm a relative layman embarking on a data science degree. I've done some research on appropriate laptops, particularly seen some advice that HP have good keyboard configurations. I'm not a fan of Macs so I was planning to grab a Windows machine and run WSL2. 

I know I'll mostly be using the university machines or operating on remote servers for big data projects, but I plan to do a lot of playing around at home too of course. Is the below laptop suitable? Or is it far too over/under specced for a data science student?

HP Envy 13-ba0010na 13.3-Inch Full HD Touch-screen Laptop (Natural Silver) (Intel Core i7-10510U, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce MX350 (2 GB Dedicated Graphics), Windows 10 Home)"
18,datascience,What’s the best and/or fastest way for a 24y/o Data Analyst to move up the corporate ladder towards a Data related position?,"I’m feeling ambitious, looking for thoughts from you guys!"
19,datascience,[Career] Anybody here contemplating a change of career?,"Full disclosure, posted (most) of the following over on r/statistics and it really resonated with a lot of people and was curious to see how people here felt. It seems that my experience isn't unique.

I see lots of posts and blogs about getting into data science that it's the sexiest job of the 20th century (TM), but very few about the fields issues or about people contemplating leaving the field. I've been doing a lot of thinking career-wise, currently working as a data scientist in the UK but getting so so tired of the grind. PhD in a stats field, which seems to be interpreted as ""kick me"". For me, the problem is the hype and expectations. Some of the people (and managers) I've worked with are completely divorced from reality. I'm thinking about a complete change of career.

My current workflow is:

1. Manger/C-level exec reads something outlandish, wants to replicate it. Makes outlandish promises to other people.
2. Non-technical manger scopes it, does a poor job; doesn't look at the data or think about how to integrate the new proposed system into the existing system; doesn't understand what's needed and throws the project at you.
3. The scope, budget, time-scale and resources have all been decided for you. ""Heres the data"", nobody bothers to see (or ask) if the data has value or is in any way related to the problem. ""Its data, it's the new oil"", ""All data has equal value \[a medium article told me so\]"". Nobody ever seem to say; ""we have data what can we learn from it""? It's ""I want X and here's some data"".
4. Project is not a two-way street; there is no appetite experimentation. You spend most of your time managing expectations, bring people back down to earth and trying to reduce scope etc. Non-technical manger doubles down on scope, budget etc. and blames project shortfalls on everybody but themselves.
5. Final project is nowhere close to what the original manager thought was possible; they are bitterly disappointed but never stop to ask themselves if they were part of the problem. At the retrospective its concluded that ""more communication is needed"".
6. Rinse and repeat.

Then there are some of your fellow data scientists who are quite happy to turn out unworkable models, butchered the stats, but claim victory. Top manager see this (and this person) as a success and sees you as somebody who is a bit too pessimistic with estimates and deliverables. I mean we can all throw non-symmetric bimodal data at model that assumes Gaussian data and call it a win, but to me that's just BS.

I feel like the hype train has left the rails and reached orbit. You are constantly up against inhuman targets. Unbelievably 40% of European AI start-ups, claiming to use ""AI"", don't actually use any AI?! \[1\]. Company execs are just gaslighting one other at this point! The problem for me is the hype coupled with management that aren't willing to invest in the resources or time needed to set up environments and workflows necessary to do data science. Management seem to expect google level results on shoestring budgets.

Is this the wrong field for me? I'm burning out; I want to work in a field where you aren't expected work miracles while competing colleagues that are peddling snake oil.

* What are your careers like? Do you guys frequently have to deal this? If so, how do you navigate this landscape? I've followed all the advice: set expectations early, up manage, frequent communication etc. Communication only works if the receiving part is actually listening.
* Have I just been unlucky with the companies I've worked in?
* Is this the standard everywhere? Is there grass greener elsewhere? I'm honestly thinking about retaining as a plumber and starting my own business.
* I know that argument can be made that the issues above are true, to some degree, within every field. But I think data science has significant issues that you do not find elsewhere: We can't even agree on the definition of a ""data scientist"" - its everything from using only excel to being fluent with AWS. And given the hype, it seems near impossible to please management.

20,datascience,What's your experience with carbon footprint detection?,"We're seeing a lot of interest in the application of data science to large scale carbon footprint detection. Particularly, with the growth of ESG (socially conscious investing) there's an interest to be able to predict/estimate this. I haven't seen a whole lot of there though. What is the community seeing?"
21,datascience,"What visualisation tool to learn, considering previous very good MS SQL knowledge?","Basically, like title. I used to programm everything in MS SQL (reports, data selections, raw data for further analysis). But when I needed to visualize the cleaned / prepared data, I used Excel as it was the easiest way for me, taking the raw data already prepared in SQL.

Now it is time for me to learn more and get to the next step of Data Analysis. If you were me and had the choice of one visualisation tool. Considering very good SQL knowledge, what would be logical choice?"
22,datascience,How best to manage uncertainty of predictions?,"I have built a price prediction model , as well as quite a simple function that simulates a decision making based based on those predictions.

Included in the data I have 95 and 50% confidence bounds, and it is multivariate, so includes the prices of other products related to the initial commodity, which can effect the initial commodities price.

What are the some industry standards for managing the price uncertainty that exists in the predictions, from both a technical and business standpoint?

Anything to point me in the right direction of managing price uncertainty in time-series forecasting would be very helpful."

24,datascience,Ghosted by consulting client...how to prevent this in the future?,"TL;DR -  I signed a contract to do part-time consulting and the client didn't pay me. How can I avoid this in the future?  Tips for vetting clients if you're doing freelance bioinformatics work?  Tips for signing contracts (like do I need to write my own?  get a lawyer to write it?)

Almost two months ago, I signed a contract to do bioinformatics consulting work for a very small company (essentially just one scientist with an LLC and an NIH grant).  She needed basic things like data fetching, data cleaning, etc., of HBV genomes.  She was in a bind, so I agreed to work quickly and I settled for $60/hr.  Way too low, I know.  But this was my first consulting experience and I weighed the experience more than the money earned.  Anyways...we agreed to terms and I did 30 hours of work for her.  (I actually did more like 45 hours of work, but I only billed 30 hrs because the rest was research on HBV genomic data.)   I sent the invoice on Oct. 30th.  She was upset that it was ""more hours than what she expected"" - although a week before I told her how many hours I had worked and explained that in addition to fetching and cleaning the data I was writing scripts to automate it for the future.  She said she understood it would be more time-intensive in the beginning and I should keep going.  Hence, 30 hrs instead of the 10 hrs which was my initial commitment.  Note: that was NOT my estimate of how much time it would take, it was the max hours I was comfortable committing to per week with my full-time job.  I said it to her exactly like that.  When she expressed disapproval of the number of hours, I stood firm and explained what I did with the time.  I reminded her that these 6 repetitive processes have now been automated, so they will be very fast.  One thing I did is I wrote up documentation for her to explain what I did, the exact parameters I used to clean data, my summary of the data quality, and the location of all the files in the AWS cloud.  No one in the past did this for her, and she literally has no idea where any of the data is located that these people she hired obtained and produced.  So we were in communication about the number of hours, and also $60/hr is really low for a bioinformatics consultant anyway. I can provide details about everything I did here if people want to judge whether it's reasonable.

I've emailed her twice in the last month for ""updates"" and it appears she has ghosted me.  I am willing to eat this $1,800 and chalk it up to a learning experience.  I have also removed all the work I did from the cloud, so unless they preemptively copied it elsewhere then they got essentially nothing from me (except for work summaries sent via email, but no data described therein).  The thing is, I still wasted my time and it was a lot of aggravation.  So how do I prevent this in the future?  I signed the contract but she never mailed me back a copy of it signed by her.   The contract is valid in the state of Virginia, but I don't live there.

I would really appreciate thoughtful advice and/or constructive criticism.  I've gotten more wonderful advice from considerate people in this subreddit than any other...I hope it continues. Thanks!"
25,datascience,Is Stata a software suite that's actually used anywhere?,"So I just applied to a grad school program (MS - DSPP @ GU). As best I can tell, they teach all their stats/analytics in a software suite called Stata that I've never even heard of.

From some simple googling, translating the techniques used under the hood into Python isn't so difficult, but it just seems like the program is living in the past if they're teaching a software suite that's outdated. All the material from Stata's publishers smelled very strongly of ""desperation for maintained validity"".

Am I imagining things?  Is Stata like SAS, where it's widely used, but just not open source?  Is this something I should fight against or work around or try to avoid wasting time on?

EDIT: MS - DSPP @ GU == ""Masters in Data Science for Public Policy at Georgetown University (technically the McCourt School, but....)"
26,datascience,Data Engineering or Data Analytics,"I recently got offered an analytics intern role, and i am expecting to be offered a data engineering role. While i am interested in the realm of data science, i do not know which aspect of data science i prefer. I do not have much experience in both fields, and while i know both are different, i do not know where do the differences lie. This led me to ponder about the positions, and their future prospects, with regards to the learning and career. These are the job responsibilities for both roles:

Analytics Intern under a research team in university:
• To support on labelling and processing of various industry-related data 
• To organise various datasets to specified requirements for use as input to predictive machine learning
• To contribute and feedback on insights regarding accuracy, completeness and organisation of datasets

Data Engineer Intern in a SME (some are points taken from the interview):
• Maintain our data inventories, collect and clean the data we have gathered from various sources to make sure of the integrity, completeness and usefulness of our data.
• Building data pipeline from different data sources
• Web crawling or scraping in python

While both positions sounds similar, I am not sure about the learning outcome. I want to pursue a career in the data industry but I am not sure of the difference in both roles. I am also aiming to apply for a Machine Learning Engineer Intern in an AI startup firm after this internship, and hope what I will learn now will help me build up experience. Can someone enlighten me please? I would like to know the difference between a data engineer and analyst, their career prospects and what they do on a daily basis at work. Thank you in advance!"
27,datascience,[Q] Popular options for ML models deployed on Java stacks?,"I've recently taken a role with a company that's been around for quite some time and built everything customer facing in Java. They're interested in making some internal ML products accessible to customers. Currently, these products exist on a Flask-based web app, using tools such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Sklearn - primarily recommender systems. 

I'm curious what others have done to allow communication between a Java stack and python (or even R, Julia, etc) based ML product. Having never worked as an SWE, I'm really taking a shot in the dark here: Maintain both stacks/web apps and create an API to pass messages back and forth..?

Alternatively, I believe that Spark is originally written in Java, so perhaps constraining ourselves to Spark modeling options would be the least invasive option..

Thoughts?"
28,datascience,Consulting or insurance,"Hello! I just receive 2 data analytics job offers; 1 in insurance and 1 in consulting. In your experience, what do you prefer? I have heard consulting is more work but I was told by the hiring manager hours do not exceed 50 hours per week. I am a new college graduate so I do not have any experience in either field. The pay is $10k more for the consulting position ($59k, $49k) but is it worth it? It is a salaried position and the insurance position is hourly, benefits are roughly equal for each."
29,datascience,Currently senior data analyst - having analysis paralysis in deciding on future career. How did you know you wanted to do data science?,"TLDR: what I really want to know from you all is did you ever have an existential data science career crisis (before entering or during), and if so, how did you deal with it, and in the end, why did you choose data science everything else (or maybe more importantly why didn't you)???

To give some context first, I am currently a 27-year old senior data analyst at a company I have been at for almost 6 years now (moving up from intern to ""junior"" to ""senior"" in that time). I came in with 0 data analysis experience beyond my Economics undergrad degree, and picked up SQL, R, Tableau, and other tools on the job. I fell in love with it immediately. I've loved creating cool dashboards, developing complex SQL queries/stored procedures/jobs, and even more recently building predictive models in R for predicting how likely an individual is to take a certain action (we have a data science team but they don't have the bandwidth to do everything). I've also designed randomized control trials and done the analysis, learned and done time series analysis, and I've created products/documents that hundreds of clients have used. My point in hashing all that out is to show that I've worn a lot of hats, and though I am nowhere near an expert on any of these things, I've enjoyed learning and, at least initially, enjoyed being a generalist and doing all these different projects.

In thinking about my future, 80% of the time over the past year or two I've thought that I really wanted to become a data scientist, because the idea of building models always fascinated me when I first started working in the business, and even caused me to try to build some on my own and learn about xgboost, lasso regression, and different approaches. I took an econometrics class in college, so I had some familiarity with regressions at least. Obviously, I'd like to be more deliberate in my work, so I've begun thinking about what it would take to become a data scientist long term. The problem for me is that I think there is a long road ahead and I don't know what the payoff is. I'd like to do an MS in statistics, but I'm not sure if that's totally necessary or the best course of action. I only have one semester of calculus done unfortunately, so I think I'd have to do two or three more so there's that (I did recently complete a linear algebra class). And there's obviously the cost to any masters degree. My company only pays $5k a year and would probably expect me to stick around, which I don't want to.

The bigger problem is that every now and again a different career path crosses my mind. What about law school?  What if I want to become a software engineer? The big one for me: What about an MBA? What about a masters -&gt; PhD in Economics? My dad is a doctor and I have a sister and several close friends in medical school so I've also wondered if I should switch into healthcare? I don't know where I want to be 5, 10, 15, 30 years down the road and it stresses me out. Every once in a while I read something that inspires me to look into a different industry. Overall, I'm very indecisive, and it's a problem. My dad tells me you just have to pick something and get on with it already, but I am not ready to do that! Haha (Edit: it’s mostly in between MBA and MS though)

So I'd love to hear someone's story of how they finally made the decision to move forward with data science and why they have or have not stuck around, and how I might think about it."
30,datascience,How do you remember/keep track of all the various things you learn?,"As someone who is fairly fresh out of university, my go-to seems to be taking pen-paper notes when reading or learning new data science topics. That said, I don't think I've ever gone back to look at the notes and do it more in hopes of the muscle memory/retention aspect. Curious if others have any ways they currently find useful for keeping track of everything they learn around data science."
31,datascience,How do you break down the core competencies in data science?,"I was wondering how you all broke down the core skills and competencies within data science at a high level?  For example, this is how I think of the field:

* Data Engineering:  Building ETL pipelines, heavy database work, more IT-related functions, etc.
* Modelling:  Develop and implement the more ""standard"" ML and Statistical Models
* Business Analytics:  Data translation, business development, and the SQL-Excel stuff
* AI:  Deep-learning and all of it's applications

Just wanted to get some thoughts on how people look at the DS field and break it a part."
32,datascience,What capabilities does your team have?,"Hi all, I'm interested in learning what capabilities and techniques other data science teams have, and I was wondering if I could post a quick survey here --- I think this is in line with the sub's policy, especially since hopefully people's answers will be interesting.

Clarification: by ""you"", I mean either yourself or someone who can work with you do do this almost immediately. Eg. not having to go to IT or anything like that?

1. Do you use other programming languages than python? (if so, what)
2. Do you use BI tools such as powerBI, Qlik, etc?
3. Do you have a direct connection to a database? (or do you just work through an API or library or something else?)
4. If so, what's the main database? (eg. postgres, ms sql)
5. Do you have the ability to host dashboards (eg using dash) for internal (to your company) use?
6. Do you have the ability to host dashboards for clients?
7. Do you have the ability to set up an API for internal use?
8. Do you have the ability to set up an API for public use?
9. Which industry do you work in.
10. How large is the company (just order of magnitude, eg. 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc)?

====================

&amp;#x200B;

Results (as of 28 replies).

1. Other than Python, data scientists used: lots of SQL, R (actually 20/28 -- it may be more competing with python more than I thought). Some javascript, Java, SAS. Occasionally C/C++, Scala, C#
2. A bit more than half the teams do use BI tools - lots of tableau, some Qlik, some powerBI

33,datascience,What do you do at work on a daily basis?,"I've been watching a few youtube videos to get an idea of what it's like to work in the industry. None of them cover really what they do on a daily basis. I was hoping you all would be willing to share what you do at work (scraping? cleaning? analysis? presenting?) and the tools you use (python? SQL? excel? etc). I would be very grateful the more detailed you can go in your descriptions (such as what packages / libraries you use e.g. Pandas\_profiling, etc)"
34,datascience,Relevant data Science training for employees,"Hi everybody, 

I recently graduated with a MS in data analytics and was fortunate enough to get hired during these times as a junior data scientist. 

The company, a cybersecurity firm, did not have an active data science department before and currently there is only one other data scientist in the company (also a recently hired junior). 

Seeing as we both did not have any background in security and networking, the first few months of training were focused on this aspect. However, we now get the opportunity to choose a relevant training / course / certificate ourselves involving data science. 

There isn't a particular budget we have to keep ourselves on, but a full on degree is out of question. I was looking at some DS courses online but can't seem to pick one out of the bunch. I know this community is mostly against certificates/MOOCs but seeing as the company does not have any real vendors/partners yet for DS, the existing training exists mostly out of security and networking, which gives us the choice to choose our own online education.

Would any of you guys know any education or training that would be beneficial for a beginning data scientist (with a background of DS through education)? A cybersecurity focused one would be a big plus as well. 

The programming language in the company is Python and I frequently have to work with SQL server and RESTful APIs to consolidate data in scripts for reporting / modelling."
35,datascience,Hate speaking with clients,"I hold a pure mathematics major  and  working as data scientist  5 years by now , I really love doing data analysis. But at this seniority level there is too much people interaction, I don't like that much to leader people, and I hate demand the stakeholders to give me feedback of the models and analysis, it were way easier when my former bosses did that for me.

And some of stakeholders really don't care about data analysis and I don't like selling to them see the importance, and some of some them have fear, or only prioritize data analysis projects if there is a senior executive telling to do this.

 I don't know what to do with my career, because I can't downgrade my career to a more junior level, and I really like data science and ain't not willing to work with anything else."

a friend and I would like to setup a Datascience cluster for some private projects. He has work experience with the HADOOP Stack, Spark and everything connected to it. I am still learning and not so experienced yet.

  
Since I have a root server I setup the Ambari Webinterface to manage my HADOOP install and other services. But I have the feeling that I am a bit overengineering the infrastructure part for our personal project. Especially the Kerberos setup for security is a bit hard for me at the moment.

40,datascience,Have you ever been asked to create an unrealistic model?,"I work for an insurance company as a data analyst and recently my manager asked me to create an unrealistic model.I have been asked to create a model to predict a 'persona type' (e.g. single parent, struggling student) based on postcode demographics data. The marketing team has come up with several persona types using personal information and survey data, and my manager wants me to somehow use that info (which doesn't have a postcode) and link it with postcode demographics.  The idea of this model is to predict what persona type is visiting our website so we can adjust our targeted ad strategy. The issue is that marketing customer segmentation has been done using survey data that includes a lot of personal information. When someone visits our website and fills out the forms we don't get any of the personal information used in that marketing analysis (GDPR and all that). My manager asked to use postcode demographics data that which includes features like

* average household income;
* the percentage of households paying child benefits, mortgage, private rent
* The average private or social rent of the property, etc.

My issue with this is that there is no way to predict persona types using just the demographic features that are on a postcode level. He wants to use this model before we have gathered any application data with personal info about the customer. I have tried explaining that there is no way of predicting persona type using the information we get from the visit, but he thinks I am just being difficult and I should just get on with it and manually come up with rules where these personas might live using my intuition. I asked him how can we validate the results because this model relies on how well I decide which postcodes have which persona type but doesn't care about that.

Anyone else has experienced something similar? How did you deal with unrealistic expectations?

**EDIT:**Thanks to everyone for their feedback. It has been extremely useful. After reading these comments and reflecting on my work, I have the tendency to have the wrong mindset when it comes to providing solutions like this. I come from an academic background where you have to have a sound methodology for your work to be accepted. Also, I am new to this field and working in a corporate environment. Key takeaway - there never will be the perfect solution and you have to work with what you got. Always attempt to solve the business problem even if you think it is bogus and come back with recommendations what can be done to make this better."

Basically, the only things I really need are a good CPU, GPU, and RAM as well as an adequate hard drive (though that's optional because I could also just use an external hard drive and take a small hit on storage speed).

46,datascience,Working as a Software engineering vs Data Scientist,"I just finished my master's in machine learning (2 years research) after doing my undergrad in computer science (4-year degree) (good schools, good marks, a few internships and I have a minor publication). I am more than qualified to work as either a software developer and as a data scientist, but I am concerned about the future if I choose to pursue a career in data science.

From what I have read, it seems like junior data scientists aren't getting jobs, it seems like more and more universities are creating dedicated data science courses (which will lead to an increase in the supply of data scientists over the next 10 years) and I am not sure how well I will do in the interview process. I am ok at math and statistics, but I can't tell you how a Naive Bayes classifier works (I can use models, but I don't understand how the underlying models work), my main skills are that I can wrangle data, run different models, understand the results of the models and deploy it in a ""production-ready"" way. 

A software engineering role (backend developer) on the other hand has been well established for more than 30 years and there is still a fairly big shortage. Given that, I feel like I am likely to be employed with a good salary indefinitely while finding the work mostly rather interesting. That being said, I fear I will not be using my full skill set and there are very few software companies that will need someone to do some machine learning on the side (which is work I do want to do).

I mainly chose to do my master's in machine learning, because, from a postgraduate perspective, computer science research is dying, while machine learning is interesting and it is easy to get a full scholarship."

48,datascience,Internship Employer Wants to Hire Me Outside the US for Full-Time,"Hey everyone, I have a (somewhat) unusual situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm graduating with my MS in Statistics next year from a respectable US university with about 1.5 years of Data Analyst experience pre-MS. I am currently interning with a (mid-size) tech startup (most people in tech / in general would not recognize its name) located in SF but that has offices all over the world. By the time I graduate, I will have interned with the company for \~ 1 year.

My manager has told me that I'm excelling at all of the requirements necessary for a full-time position and that the team is looking to hire more Data Scientists next year, with me as a natural pick since the company has liked my work thus far. Yet leadership has indicated that most (if not all) new engineering / DS talent is to be hired in non-US offices in order to ""contain costs"". That for the cost of paying me an SF salary, ""we can probably get 2-4 engineers / DS elsewhere"". For perspective, DS usually start around 135-140k total comp at my company in the Bay Area.

While I would be thrilled to be able to be a DS somewhere abroad (just for the life experience), my mentors think that this would be a mistake for my early career as a DS, especially if I intend to remain in the US longterm (which I do) due to the potential hit to my finances (would get paid \~30-60% less in USD in potential locations, despite decreased CoL, potentially unable to contribute to retirement accounts, etc.), less career mobility, and lower negotiating power in future positions. They advised me to stay in the US (preferably SF, Seattle or NY) to build my career before branching out elsewhere. Based on their advice, I'm torn between being willing to move abroad for the life experience vs. staying here in the US.

Though I have not gotten an official offer, given that I have \~7 months until graduation, do you think I start looking for another company? Or, do you think the experience of being a DS abroad is a unique experience that makes me a better DS going forward? How should I approach this?

Though there is no correct answer, what is everyone's thoughts on this? Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT #1: The company has not said they will only hire me outside the US. But my manager told me that leadership has indicated that ""you need to show that you are worth relatively more than what we could get elsewhere for less money"".

EDIT #2: I'm a domestic US resident (born in SF actually). No debt upon graduation."

My project entailed the following:

* I used Selenium to visit the page for every property in my metro area and download it as an HTML (the HTML files were organized by county and city)
* I used BeautifulSoup to parse each HTML and extract the listings and information (such as amenities) for each property
* I used SKLearn to split up the data for each city into a training set and a test set, train a model for each city, and compare the predictions for the test set to the rents for the test set

I know how I can write this on my resume, but I’m wondering how I can make it presentable if someone actually wants to see my work. I know I should put it on my GitHub, but I don’t really know much beyond that.

First things first - how should I handle the raw data that I downloaded and parsed? Due to TOS concerns, I’m thinking of not including the HTMLs or the data that I parsed from them in the repo. I did create a few scripts that actually did the downloading, parsing, and dataset generation. Should I make those part of the repo?

Should I just create, say, an iPython notebook where I show the feature engineering I did and generate a few plots to show my results? If I don’t make the data/HTMLs part of the repo, should I at least verbally describe the data (files, columns, etc.) and the process by which I procured it?"

I am confused with this basic concept relating to network graphs and clustering (also called ""community detection"") : if you have nodes and edges, how do you incorporate node attributes into the clustering? I have often seen ""edge weights"" being used in network graph clustering (e.g. see here: [igraph.org/r/doc/cluster\_louvain.html](https://igraph.org/r/doc/cluster_louvain.html)) ... but I have never seen anyone being able to make use of ""node attributes"" (covariates associated with the nodes) within the clustering.

It seems to me, if you really want to make a network graph in which ""node attributes"" are used for the clustering - you can either make something called a ""weighted correlation network"" ([cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WGCNA/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WGCNA/index.html)) and perform clustering algorithms on this weighted correlation network (made using pairwise correlations between points) ..... or you can make a KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) graph (using Euclidean Distances between points) and run MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) clustering algorithms on the graph.

BUT, when you use the Weighted Correlation Network or the KNN graph - you will inevitably end up losing (valuable) information about the natural relationships between nodes within the network. Example : suppose you have relationships between a group of friends (edges: John knows Jack, Jack knows Jim, Jim knows John) and you have Node Attributes for each member in the group (Age, Salary, Debt, etc.). A standard binary graph would just be made using the relationships between these friends ...but would not be able to take advantage of the age, salary and debt of these friends for clustering purposes. On the other hand: making a KNN graph or Weighted Correlation Network would be able to make use of the age, salary and debt of these friends .... but would not be able to make use of the natural relationships between these friends. I guess you could infer (via the principle of ""homophily"") that people are more likely to make friends with people who are more similar (in terms of node attributes) to them ... but it still seems that ""natural edges"" (friendships) will be lost.

My question: is there a way to do graph network clustering using node attributes AND the edges?

Could someone please try and help me out?

Thanks"

I’m experienced with Google sheets but I have never created something of this type. I have lots of experience w data and a PhD (not sure if that’s relevant), but I’m just trying to figure out an honest hourly rate. I feel like charging an ‘expert rate’ isn’t 100% fair because I will probably be kind of slow and having to look stuff up along the way.

It requires knowledge of a multitude of subjects to work effectively. One of the things that make data science interesting is solving problems. If you’re deterred by the idea of having to solve problems, and instead go with the flow and take how things are, getting into data science is a bad idea.

73,datascience,NYC Income Data,I'm looking for data for income in NYC broken down by year and neighborhood for years 2001-2006 inclusive for a school project. I can find more recent years fairly easily but the older data seems to be hard to find. If anyone has any leads please let me know. Thanks.
74,datascience,Putting a project on my resume that used scraped data,"I've been trying to build up my data science resume and I was finally able to put together something that I think would look decent on it. Basically, I used Selenium to view every listing in my metro area on a major apartment listing website, downloaded the HTMLs, scraped the downloaded HTML's to build up a dataset, and then built a model to predict the rent of an apartment based on various parameters (square footage, ZIP code, amenities, etc.).

The listing website's Terms of Service didn't explicitly forbid scraping - meaning that they didn't use the exact word ""scraping"" - but they still forbade a lot of things that would essentially constitute scraping. How should I go about listing this project on my resume in a way that doesn't get me into trouble? Should I just not go into detail about how I procured the dataset? Should I not mention the website? Should I abandon putting this project on my resume altogether?"

77,datascience,When can you say you “know” Python?,"Like what is the line exactly? 

Is being able to use numpy, pandas, sklearn, scipy, statsmodels and perhaps tf.keras good enough? And writing basic functions. 

Because lot of those things are pretty easy and still mostly in the statistical programming realm. Its just sort of like using Python to emulate R. I still have to look up a lot of things especially with pandas and statsmodels though and some sklearn models. 

Or do you have to know OOP with classes?

Being able to use dictionaries, iterators etc? Coming from R I don’t really use these too much. I usually just define the length of the vector and use range() in a loop for example. Dictionaries only in like sklearn gridsearchCV or making pandas dfs. 

Do you have to be able to use generators and all the fancy things?

I feel like I say I “know” Python but some stuff I see people and books doing especially in the DL area with generators and so on is beyond me. I never took a formal Python course and so I kind of just end up copy-pasting that part without knowing what its doing. Or like inheritance/subclassing is something I don’t fully get. I can understand the Keras sequential and model fitting, tuning based on train/val error stuff of course but that is the more statistical part. 

Maybe one never truly “knows” a language as there is always more...But what is considered enough on average?

TLDR: Basically, to say you “know” Python do you have to know beyond just emulating R in Python. Like would you say you need to know more general programming concepts?

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses! Seems like I would say theres a lot more general Python programming I gotta learn outside these libraries. I have been getting a bit bored just doing data analysis in Rmarkdown/jupyter nbs alone so maybe it could be a fun thing to do on the side."

I guess I'm asking if I'll need to learn the inner workings of libraries/modules, how to structure a large Python project, etc. Or if learning the syntax enough to write algorithms and move data around is most of the battle.

Hope this wasn't too vague. Again it's coming from someone who's primarily built web apps in .NET and who knows .1% more about data science than the person who uses it as a buzzword."

81,datascience,Are data science interviews harder now than a few years ago?,"I am an ML engineer with a few years of experience.  I had a data science interview a few days ago at another company.  The job is at a fortune 500 non-tech company.




The interviewer asked a variety of questions.  I was asked a leetcode medium dynamic programming question, a simple string manipulation question, some pretty tricky math problems, and some pretty trick data engineering systems design questions.




I would say the hardest question was challenging, but appropriate for an interview.  But I felt like I struggled through the interview because my brain was in 10 different places.  One minute, I was in software engineering mode.  The other minute, I was solving math problems.  And the next minute, I was in devops mode.

85,datascience,Thought I nailed presentation on pipeline I built. Business ppl were like 'where are the results?' Ugh.,"Warning -- venting ahead.

I'm new at a datasci job that I generally like and have spent a couple of weeks on a very heavy data wrangling problem in Python where I basically am taking some very ugly data distributed across multiple sources, and doing lots of magic with it that builds a pipeline that ultimately yields a single postgres database running from a docker container, all of which will scale, will be really easy to use, all done using Jupyter so everyone can use it, including a db schema visualization within Jupyter. Now when anyone in the future wants to rebuild the database they basically just have to hit a button. Also there are lots of utilities to ensure db integrity (basically lots of tests built in).

In my presentation my crowning achievement in my mind was that you could literally hit one key and the db immediately is reconstructed from scratch, while I'm talking. So as the thing is running and the db is being populated during this live demo, and I'm beaming with pride. The main boss person is like ""Great what are the results?""

I fucking died inside. That *was* the result for this work period....ugggggg.

I guess I'm using to working in a team where everyone gets excited by nerdy data stuff. I had to figure out how to say ... ""Ummm we have a database now you damned @#$#"" in a nice way.

Anyway I'm feeling pretty pissed and dejected now. Like...sheesh. Trying to rediscover my motivation at this point."

I mean, when should I apply t-SNE? Why should I choose it instead of UMAP, for instance? What kind of information can it give me about the data? When you apply t-SNE, what information do you retrieve for it? Could someone please explain me why t-SNE is such a resilient algorithm in data science? What am I missing?

For an example, let's say as part of an internal toolkit you want to find the percentage of zeros for certain columns in a dataset. That's the only current use case for your new function, but it's possible that you'll need to calculate other types of percentages in the future. I can think of a few options for the new function, going from very specific to very generalized:

1. function accepts an array or list and returns the percentage of zeros in that data. Handle which columns to send to this function in another function.
2. function accepts the dataset and a list of columns, then returns the percentage of zeros per column
3. function accepts the dataset, a list of columns, the target numerator (0, in this case), the target denominator (number of non-nulls in the column, in this case), and then returns the percentage of zeros per column
4. something even more generalized: can be used to calculate any type of percentage you can imagine and accepts dictionaries of column name, numerator, denominator, etc.

How do you draw the line at where to stop future-proofing when the current use case of the new function is very limited?"

I'm still a n00b in this field, but I'm trying to push a paper out fairly quickly.  The thing is, getting experimental labels is very challenging and may take several months.  However, I have the ability to simulate the system fairly accurately.  

**Project:**  To compute the surface of an imaged object using CNN

**Input:**  x,y,z intensity.  There is a strong response from the surface of the object, turning this project into a ""noisey"" peak finding algorithm.  The surface should be continuous and change slowly in x and y, but only yield a single value for every x,y location.

**Output:** x,y  image yielding the height of the object.  A single image is the output showing a map of the surface. 

**Idea:** I can simulate a range of x,y,z inputs with perfect response and with an added amount of expected variance we see experimentally. This would serve as a ground truth.  I could test it on a subset of the simulated data, to establish the model.  Then maybe the ""hail mary"" is that I observe its performance on experimental data. 

I've already built a model using a UNet CNN with experimental data and hand created labels - although without ground truth it is not exactly clear how accurate it is, but the results are reasonable.  The model performs very well with hand labelled data.  The output value is a classification of 1 from 20 options (each a different binned location in z).  

Thoughts on this? Things I am not considering?

124,datascience,Feeling like shit after being rejected from two internships,"About a month ago now, I interviewed for a data analyst internship for a well-known tech company, and another internship for an insurance company. I was officially denied from both last week, and am feeling pretty terrible in general.

For the tech company, the first interview went fine. It was over the phone. The interviewer seemed engaged and I had answers for all of his questions, both technical and behavioral. He also seemed to like and be engaged with my answers. However, the interview was 15 minutes shorter than was planned, which worried me. Despite that, within a couple of days, the company reached out to schedule another interview with another person.

This second interview is where everything went wrong. This interview was also over the phone, but my interviewer called me about 15 minutes late and didn't really seem very engaged. She would yawn while I was speaking and never asked any follow-up questions. I also didn't have nearly as good responses to her questions either. When it got to the technical part of the interview, I screwed up by mentioning that my experience in SQL was only academic experience. This resulted in us skipping over the SQL questions and ending the interview then and there.

I already felt like I was no longer under consideration by the time we hung up, but I was officially rejected last week.

On the other hand, my interviews for the insurance company went spectacularly. The phone screening was great; the interviewer seemed engaged. My second interview was behavioral with two interviewers and went similarly well; they also seemed engaged and responded well to my answers. The technical interview went well too because my interviewer said I had great and thorough answers. Every interview went well. I'm sure of it, because the recruiter said she called me several times, but received no answer. She then emailed me to inform me that they'll be moving on with other candidates because I never responded. The thing is, I never received the calls or emails. I checked all my call logs from now to before the interview, and I never missed any calls. I also searched my inbox and spam box, and couldn't find any email from that company either. So I'm not sure what I could have done.

The tech position didn't go well, and I already knew I lost that position before the interview was even over. But I felt like I nailed the insurance position. I met all the qualifications. I did well in the phone screening, the behavioral interview, and technical interviews. I felt like I did everything right, but somehow, I still screwed up and lost the position.

I'm especially worried because I'm in my third year, so this summer's internship is the one that'll most likely lead to a full-time post-grad position.

I'm currently working one part-time internship with a non-profit, so I'm going to try to get on some projects that are more analysis-related and SQL-related so I could improve my confidence in SQL. I'm also working a very part-time research internship (I'm talking about one or two hours a week) that is analysis/data science-related. I'm nearing the end of that position, but I might try to stick with it for a while longer

I'm in the interview stage for one other internship, but that's it. I could extend my non-profit internship over the summer, but it's not really analysis or data science-related. I'll continue applying to more internships, but right now, that's all I got.

What do I do now? Am I worrying too much? I'd love any advice you can give me"
125,datascience,Is Bayesian stats useful in practice at all?,"I'm considering taking a Bayesian stats course for the next semester of my grad program, but it's taught by a researcher with a poli sci background and is framed in the social science context. However, I was wondering how companies outside of that very niche space actually utilize Bayesian stats, if at all."
126,datascience,A little advice after 15 years in this field as an industry practitioner and academic.,"I noticed an inflow of people disappointed that the field is not what they thought it would be employment wise.

Correct me if I'm wrong but my overall feeling is that you are not reaping the rewards your masters/bootcamp/online course promised. You are not turning down people left and right asking for your services. And thus, you feel like the field is not what you wanted.

A bit of my background I started doing ""data science"" back in 2005, I have a Masters and a PhD on applied Machine Learning. I've done consulting in AI for NTT Japan (largest IT company in the country), done 2 postdocs in top 20 Universities, both of them on applied AI to Science. Consulting to the largest companies in LatAm, and currently on charge of 10+ ML/DataScience experts as ML Director as one of the Largest Banks in LatAm by assets.

* 1st Advice. If you are in it for the money, better invest wisely.

**If you have no experience**. Don't spend 400 usd in 400 little Udemy classes, or a Datacamp subscription, etc. Spend big and go to a big name school to do a Masters, there are plenty of funding options. Believe me, even if you learn the same thing, the fact that your certification/course says MIT instead of DataCamp is my only pointer if you don't have field experience at all. I say it again, this is **IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE.**

* 2nd Advice. Get all the experience you can, even if it's pro bono!

There is nothing like working with real datasets, I couldn't care less if you did all the tutorials on tensorflow or Sklearn using MNIST or Fashion MNIST, guess what, so did the other 40 applicants. But if you were privy to any datasets that few people can access, then I can see some value if your business understanding and capability of deploying ML techniques with data that no one else has seen before.

Sound hard? no, is extremely easy, the fact that there is a shortage of talent is no illusion. Go to a local University and look for researchers that might need to use ML in something, and offer to do that analysis, or only cleaning the data for free. That gives you both experience and opens doors for future employment.

The most interesting datasets I've seen have been in projects that I did for free or very little money.

* 3rd Advice. Learn the business and build yourself a niche.

Again, there is a need for DS and ML practitioners, that is very real, I have 3 open positions right now. But guess what? I won't hire anyone with no Finance or related experience. I need people capable of understanding business terms, and are capable of reading a Cash Flow and an Income Statement. Few applicants really know how to do it or have any interest in how to do it.

I have friend in the oil industry and is the same story all over again, people just want access to a dataset with no interest in learning about oil or extracting processes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Notice that all this advice is to give you all that extras and plus that you will need to get hired, doing a bootcamp or a course is not good enough anymore, you need to differentiate yourself."
127,datascience,I'm bored of hearing about ML and about the DS career path.,"What interesting non-ML things have you been working on?

Could be anything really. Physical models, signal processing, network analysis, causal analysis, agent based models, combinatorial problems, decision theory, game theory, information theory, are you working directly with with unstructured data, do you have sampling challenges to overcome like irregularly sampled sequential data or sparsely sampled non-normal distributions, are you using traditional methods for, for example, computer vision or timeseries forecasting.

Obviously the list above is unstructured and non-exhaustive, but I hope you see my point. I just want to hear about some unusual problems or methods which might require a little more thought than the norm.

Thanks in advance."
128,datascience,Hour One ARM Mac Thoughts,"I just got an ARM MacBook Air and the other day, u/sackafackaboomboom posted about if ARM Macs make sense for Data Science work.

## Wait what?
So quick summary, Apple released new M1 chips for their entry level computers this month, which takes the iPhone/iPad A-series chips and optimizes them to run Mac. I've seen very few people talk about M1 for Data Science tasks... so here I am.


## Yes Anaconda Runs. But that's not what you think it means.
[Edit since original post... and since previous edit] Yes, there is an ARM based version of Miniconda which doesn't come with all the packages, but comes with a slick speed up bonus. I posted a little more about this on my notes: https://github.com/mwidjaja1/DSOnMacARM/blob/main/README.md

---

## Before you Judge Me...
1.	Yes, this is an incredibly quick, un-scientific, hot takes on Benchmarks on the new ARM Macs versus two other Macs. I get that. This is just a quick hot take for those who just want a feel on where these new M1 Macs are.
2.	Yes, I know there are far smarter &amp; efficient ways to do data science than on a Mac without a NVIDIA GPU. A Mac is not the right tool for many jobs, but may be your only tool that you have available. This post is more of “If you only had an M1 Mac, could you get away with it?” as opposed to “Should I do all my work on a Mac from now on and pretend nothing else exists?”

## What are you gonna test?
The three computers I tested these benchmarks on are a:

-	2017 $2,000+ iMac: 3.8 GHz 4 Core i5, 16 GBs RAM. Geekbench 1095 Single &amp; 3336 Multi Core.
-	2020 $3,000+ 16” MacBook Pro: 2.3 GHz 8-Core i9, 64 GBs RAM. 1088 Single &amp; 6883 Multi Core.
-	2020 $1,400 MacBook Air: 8-Core m1, 8 GBs RAM. Geekbench 1296 Single &amp; 4601 Multi Core.
-	[Added after the original post] 2018 $1,400 MacBook Air. GeekBbnch 761 Single &amp; 1560 Multi Core.

I’m going to try a (1) Machine Learning Model and (2) Neural Network on these three Macs. Note that none of these tests will exceed the RAM available on any of these machines —thought that would be a fun test one day.

## Sklearn: Interesting
[Edit since original post] I originally ran this using the Intel Sklearn on my ARM Macbook because I goofed. These results are using the ARM Sklearn on my ARM Macbook now.

So then I thought, how about just a normal Sklearn Random Forest Classifier? I spun up Homebrew* and Anaconda and wrote this quick test script:

```python
iris = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris[‘‘ata’’, iris[‘‘arget’’)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds = model.predict(X_test)
digits = load_digits()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(digits[‘‘ata’’, digits[‘‘arget’’)
model = GradientBoostingClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds = model.predict(X_test)
```

I ran this script three times on each machine and the averaged times were:

-	2017 iMac: 4.87 + 5.35 + 5.11 =&gt; 5.11 Avg Secs
-	2020 MacBook Pro: 4.70 + 4.71 + 4.72 =&gt; 4.71 Avg Secs
-	2020 MacBook Air: 3.87 + 3.92 + 4.11 =&gt; 3.95 Avg Secs

## TensorFlow: YESSS!
[Edit since original post] Since I made this post, Apple has released TensorFlow for m1. I ran into lots of installation issues trying to incorporate this with my Conda environment, so if you're in my boat, check out my notes at: https://github.com/mwidjaja1/DSOnMacARM/blob/main/README.md

Here are the benchmarks with Apple's Tensorflow.

- iMac: 629 Seconds
  - 3.8 GHz 4 Core i5, 16 GBs RAM. Geekbench 1095 Single &amp; 3336 Multi Core.
- Macbook Air: 398 Seconds
  - 8-Core m1, 8 GBs RAM. Geekbench 1296 Single &amp; 4601 Multi Core

## Docker, eGPU, Windows: No
Docker posted about how they won’t have optimized versions for M1 until around 2021 so if you MUST have Docker, don’t jump ship for now. Ditto for Windows support (beyond virtualization... though please accept my sympathies if you must data science with Windows). And don’t think about using an eGPU, they do not work with the M1 Macs.

## Pytorch
Fortunately a simple `pip install pytorch torchvision` worked unlike TensorFlow, so I used this for my Deep Learning benchmarks.

I used the MNIST Example Code from https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/mnist/main.py. It’s worth emphasizing these are not ARM optimized versions of PyTorch, this is a brutally unfair comparison of a PyTorch optimized for Intel on an $1.3k MacBook Air for entry level users versus honking Laptops &amp; Desktops designed for ML/DL that are many thousands more.

I ran this script twice, excluding the downloading portion (since it seems unfair to benchmark on download speeds), which led to these averaged times: 

-	2017 iMac: 1513.83 + 1483.67 =&gt; 1498.75 Avg Secs
-	2020 MacBook Pro: 1441.37 + 1452.16 =&gt; 1446.77 Avg Secs
-	2020 MacBook Air: 2180.46 + 2177.52 =&gt; 2178.99 Avg Secs
-	2018 MacBook Air: 1973 Avg Secs (Yes, the old Intel Macbook with pathetic GeekBench scores beat the m1 Mac)

Ouch, these numbers look bad. But, let’s also consider these three things:

-	PyTorch is optimized for Intel, and if there’s an ARM version of PyTorch (I think there probably is), I didn’t get a chance to run it tonight. So the MacBook Air has two hands tied behind its back running PyTorch in emulation mode.
-	The MacBook Air does not have a fan and PyTorch made the Mac reach its thermal maximum. In these situations, the Mac ties a third hand behind its back, and throttles itself. It would be cool to try this on a MacBook Pro or Mac mini with a Fan &amp; M1.
-	The MacBook Air is designed for YouTube Users, not PyTorch Users.

And in that light, no, the MacBook Air is not the machine for Deep Learning. But it’s terrifyingly scary how it can hold its own and the whole time, the Mac didn’t crap out.

# Summary [Revised since original post]
I revised this summary since my original post because TensorFlow is now available on Arm and Miniconda is on ARM.

TensorFlow, optimized for ARM, eats Intel. 

But there are many things not optimized for Intel, that you'd really think should, such as Docker, Jupyter Notebooks, Scikit-Learn, and 'normal' Anaconda as opposed to the ARM optimized Miniconda I'm using. In those cases, most of the time, you can use Rosetta to get back up and running with an emulated version, but that's not always going to work.... or work well, as in the case with PyTorch.

But remember, the fact that Macbook Air M1, with no fan, using a brand new architecture, is anywhere this fast to some of the fastest Intel iMacs is terrifyingly amazing. In due time with good development, it'll probably do everything we want and then some.

In the meanwhile, if you're gonna get an ARM Mac for Data Science, you'd probably want a Mac Mini or Macbook Pro just so you get the fan... and get 16 GBs of RAM please. But if you're stuck on a desert island with a Macbook Air and need to run a model, chances are, you can make do with an Air. 

—

* Important to note though, at first, the MacBook Air took WAY longer. Turns out Rosetta has to compile all x86 programs first to the new ARM architecture. So I got these benchmarks by importing all the packages I wanted first in Python and then I can run any of my scripts using those packages to get that 0.07 seconds. To force something in the terminal to run on Rosetta, you must start the command with `arch -x86_64`"

130,datascience,Prior knowledge for a data science study,"Need some help and hints. I m from Switzerland and have finished my training as an automation engineer. I did also the vocational high school in technology and science.

In my training of 4 years I have worked with Siemens S7, Tia and a little bit with Linux. In my free time I did sometimes little projects with Arduino, Raspberry pi or with Python but I would still say I m a beginner...

Im not sure if this Data Science is too hard for me because I never had informatics in this topic and also nothing else serious in this subject area. My knowhow about informatics is also not really big. But all this AI, Big Data, Machine learning interests me really hard. At the moment I do a course for Python on Udemy.

Now my question, am I able with my knowledge to do this course?

Person B) Data Analyst with no SQL knowledge, but very good knowledge in BI-Tools

133,datascience,Anyone else feel like this field is getting overvalued by industry?,"I feel like so many of the roles in this field are born out of some kind of misguided FOMO by upper management. They have anchored themselves to buzzwords of the day without really understanding any of it. I go on plenty of interviews with companies who do not really seem to understand or are incapable of communicating the business need behind the creation of the position they seek to fill. It kind of scares me because I feel like we are going to end up with a situation in the near future where management has a come-to-jesus moment and decides to have a wholesale housecleaning of what will have turned out to be an expensive, ill-conceived adventure in rudderless management."

136,datascience,How to handle constant priority switching,"My company got a new CEO six months ago. Ever since, there is a constant deluge of “high priority, in-depth questions” that we’re pulling data and doing analysis for. Before this, we’d have occasional deep dives and reports but could focus on longer term projects. Now, the new “high priority” request comes in before the last one finishes, causing us to abandon work and leave things unfinished constantly.

We used to be seen as people who tackle these single, practical, value-add projects. Now we’re seen as the “smart folks” who can answer any question or figure out any problem with our voodoo data magic. Hence the constant ad hoc requests.

Anyone else run into this? Any advice? It’s good to be in demand, but I feel like what I’m doing is less and less actual Data Science. Could this hurt my career?"

Here is my intended application: clients with their portfolios arrive (portfolios have 10 financial variables) at a management company - either the client will quit during the process (censor), or stay until their portfolio is completed (event). The time that either of of these take place are recorded (historical data is available).

So if 3 new clients come in, a cox proportional hazards regression model is made for all 3 clients, and their estimated survival curves are compared. Based on how steep their estimated survival curves are, they are ""triaged"" - i.e. steeper survival curves are dealt with first because its seen as more volatile."
139,datascience,Time / Sequence Based Analysis,"Hi,

I'm almost too afraid to ask at this point, but I can't seem to find good guides on how to go about this, and I'm pretty sure the way I do it is inefficient. 

Sometimes I've got data where the sort order matters and I want to do some sort of time or sequence based analysis. Small example below:

Data:

    pd.DataFrame(data = {'Time': [1,2,3,1,2,3], 'ID': [1,1,1,2,2,2], 'Value': [100,65,50,100,75,62]})

| Time   | ID   | Value  |
|:-------|-----:|:-------:|
| 1       |1      |100     
| 2       |1      |65   
| 3       |1      |50    
| 1       |2      |100     
| 2       |2      |75   
| 3       |2      |62    


Say I want to know when an ID dropped below a certain threshold of ""value"" for the first time. What is the Pythonic way to do figure that out? My solution is gross:

    threshold = .70
    df['Flag'] = np.where(df.Value &lt; threshold, 1, 0))
    cumulative_target = df.groupby('ID')['Flag'].cumsum().rename('Occurrence').reset_index()
    df['UnderThreshold'] = cumulative_target.Occurrence
    df['TimeUnderTheshold'] = np.where((df.Flag == 1) &amp; (df.UnderTheshold == 1), df.Time, None)

Now I can also do:

    df.TimeUnderThreshold.mean() 

To get the average time it takes to get under the threshold. So, in this case, the average time to get under the threshold is 2.5.

Would be great to hear your thoughts."
140,datascience,"Data Engineer, watching upper management contract out work that I feel that I'm capable of doing","I have been working in data analytics with my company for about two years now. This past year, after some pushing I was able to get a pretty good promotion and changed my title to ""Data Engineer"" since I found myself providing support in improving our data infrastructure and automating some data processing tasks that have been required for transferring data from one system to the other. I do feel that I've been carving my own path - the people above me aren't exactly sure what I do, aside from ""coding"" and being an ""excel guru"", but it's been working out okay since they are happy with the results of my work.

There is a definite need for more robust database integrations (we have so much silo'd data) which my company understands. I have recently been learning about how to use APIs to build system integrations and I would love to put this into practice at my company, however I can't seem to relay that information to upper management. Because they they are not technical and see this kind of stuff as more complicated than they care to try to understand, they are getting quotes from third party companies to ""make this happen, whatever it is."" I know I'm not an expert right now, but I have been able to test/learn from sandbox environments and I worry that I will never become an expert if I don't have the opportunity to try in a real-life application. It is frustrating to see them reviewing these quotes from software engineer contractors who are asking for an amount that is equivalent to over half of my annual salary to do something that would be a really good development opportunity for me, and which I don't think would take me more than a week to implement.

I try to tell my managers, ""hey this seems like a lot of money for something that I could figure out how to do in a week..."" but they usually just respond ""oh don't worry about the cost, we have the budget and we just want a quick win."" It's hard to hear that because even though I've been promoted since I started, it has been impossible for me to negotiate a salary adjustment to closer to an average data engineer in my region. I know I'm not as experienced as these external software engineers, but how am I ever going to get there if they are so quick to hire externally for these types of things?"

We have a decent sized team and I manage \~20 people though our team is a few times bigger. I come at Data Science from the Analytics side and was already mid-career when the company formed a Data Science team. I don't have a masters degree or any advanced education, though I am considering school, I also know some traditional paths to education just aren't going to happen at this point in my life.

I see a few education profiles out there for Data Science managers.

1. PhD/Masters in Computer Science / Statistics / Mathematics / etc, where their education gave them direct training on at least some of the techniques being used. (My experience is that companies hire and pay PhDs/Masters in these fields about the same).
2. PhD in mostly unrelated area, perhaps a social or physical science, where their PhD program mostly taught them how to do research and develop an expertise. Some of their studies are relevant to day to day but its not always the case. (My experience is these people need the PhD beyond the masters to get hired).
3. Masters in Analytics, MSIS, Data Science, Predictive Analytics, etc, partnered with 5-10 years of experience working with data, databases, visualization, etc. (Experience is Key)
4. MBAs are held by some Data Science managers I've encountered-- though its slightly rare, I've ran across more than a few. (Usually have 15-20+ years experience).

I currently have a PG Cert in Statistics, which helps a bit, but as I look at my career, I think I need an advanced degree or I will hit a career wall, or want to change jobs and be unable. I am trying to decide what path to choose, but its obviously challenging.

My intuition is: If you have 10 polls for the same political campaign, each with a +/- 3 point MOE, and 9 of them give the same candidate as winning, the MOE of the average should be less than +/- 3, i.e., the aggregate MOE is less than any individual poll. Is this correct?"

**The other**: Before I got into data, I did 10 years in finance IT, so I'm strong on tech skills. So DE sounds fun, building ETLs, infrastructure, working with AWS, etc. Sooooo many jobs and great pay.

But I kind of lean towards analysis, like to script, want to do more data viz, and eventually want to do more machine learning. As I've searched, I found there are some jobs out there that do it all.

How would you approach this?"
162,datascience,Understanding the Hiring Process (so you can make it work for your),"There have been a lot of anti-hiring-process rants in the last few weeks. It's true that hiring processes suck in a lot of places. It's also true that the market for inexperienced people is very competitive. But ranting about it isn't going to change anything and isn't going to make your job search easier. So this post is about understanding why some of the annoying, bad, and lazy parts of the hiring process are in place, and what you can do to overcome them.

# There is no manual or training about how to make a successful DS hiring process.

Given how broad the term ""data scientist"" applies to different types of roles, finding the correct hiring components can require a significant amount of work and preparation, from designing or choosing problems, getting your recruiter up-to-speed on the correct filters to apply, and training your team to actually perform the interviews. Most hiring process problems exist because there is no incentive to spend the appropriate amount of time getting ready.

There are lots of ideas about how to do this well out there, but there are also trade-offs to any specific aspect. For example, there is lots of literature suggesting work-samples are the most predictive task a potential hire can do as part of the interview process. However, actually having candidates do these samples and then grading them is hugely expensive, not to mention coming up with good tasks is quite difficult. And it's well known that the filter this applies on candidates willing to do the tasks may bias the hiring pool in ways you might not like. So even building the correct hiring process for a given role has lots of trade-offs and requires lots of work.

On the other hand, it's easy to do things well-known companies are doing. It's pretty well known that leetcode-style tests are not super good indicators for data science skills, and might even be anti-predictive for certain roles. There might even be some goodish reasons why these tests are used at super large companies (i.e. it's easy to train 10k software engineers to give these types of interviews and get standardized results). However, most companies are only doing this because the larger companies are doing it, even if they would get better results from a process that doesn't scale. As they say, ""Nobody ever got fired for copying Google."" The same logic to applies to ""behavioral"" interviews that ask the cliche questions like ""Tell me your greatest weakness."" Somehow these interviews became common practice, even though nobody knows how to interpret the answers.

Also, most places don't train their interviewers at all. I think having people shadow more experienced interviews is a common practice, but formal training, even regarding legal issues, is not very widespread. 

# There are extreme levels of applicants for most data science roles.

Nearly [2M](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables/dt19_322.10.asp) people graduate with bachelor's degrees in the US every year. (Sorry, this will be a US-centric post). Of those, at least 300k would qualify based on field of study for jobs in the data-science realm, and probably more like 500k. More than [800k](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables/dt19_323.10.asp) receive Master's degrees and at least 150k are in fields relevant to DS. And just because someone doesn't have a degree that would be a stereotypical match for DS doesn't mean they're not qualified. It also doesn't mean they won't apply anyway.

It's not uncommon to get 1000+ applicants for a role. Anywhere from 0 - 500 of them could be qualified, depending on the role. My team just had a job listing that was open for 2 days and got 200 applicants. The listing was closed to keep the level of applications manageable.

Keep in mind that a hiring pipeline can be thought of just like any other funnel analysis with the objective of hiring the best qualified candidate at the lowest cost. This means putting low cost steps earlier in the funnel and focusing on high precision at the cost of recall and accuracy.

People reviewing this load of applications will do anything they can to increase their precision. Filtering on degree, school, GPA, etc. are just easy but defensible ways to throw out applications without reading them. If a recruiter can reduce 1000 down to 50 by requiring PhD or masters, that's still plenty of resumes to read and pass to the next layer.

Doing any form of technical screening is expensive because someone with a technical background needs to do it. That's why many companies are using automated technical screeners or having their recruiters asking questionnaires. Unfortunately, there are many applicants who cannot do even answer the most basic questions or write code to solve extremely problems, making these types of screens highly useful.

# What can you do?

* Do your research on the hiring process at any company you are interviewing at. You should explicitly ask your contact what will be covered in the interview.
* Don't be afraid to ask to delay an interview to give you some time to prepare for unusual modules. Most companies aren't going to care if you need to wait a couple weeks. Most large companies aren't going to care if you want to wait a couple months.
* Don't sell yourself short when choosing jobs to apply to. The poor preparation for job listings works both for and against you. You may find yourself interviewed for a job you don't match the listing for and be a perfect fit.
* Don't take it personally if you fail an interview (especially if you thought it went well). Failing an interview doesn't mean you did badly in the interview, that you weren't qualified for the job, or that you're not a strong candidate. There's just too much randomness in most hiring processes to draw much of any conclusion.
* Do protect your own time. If some company asks you to commit your time to some interview tasks, make sure the value is there for you. Doing a data challenge before you've talked to a hiring manager might not be a great idea, because you're committing several hours before they've even done a basic assessment of you. Some companies will ask you to do an automated code challenge before a human has read your resume.
* Do make sure your resume stands out, especially if you only have a bachelor's going for entry-level jobs. In a crowd of hundreds, why is your resume the one that the recruiter is going to pick out?
* Do spend some time preparing for common interview types even if you think they're irrelevant. Yes, leetcode questions aren't that relevant to most people's jobs. But it does unlock a certain class of jobs for you and the return on doing some leetcode questions is pretty good if it helps you get a job.

# End

I hope some people will find this helpful. I know that for people who are unemployed or just entering the workforce (especially now), that searching for jobs is especially stressful. But I hope understanding that it's much less of a judgment of you than it feels like will help take away a little bit of the stress of the process."

165,datascience,How to deal with time series projections that contains covid lockdown anomalies? (Crazy sales figures),"I have a dataset of sales figures - from Jan 2018 to present. Supermarket data with basically every type of item.

I am trying to project overall sales out to 2021.

The increase in sales is nice and regular starting at Jan 2018, until we get to a huge anomalous surge in activity around March / April / May this year. This is affecting the projections. If I include this activity in the training data, the projections are as much as 20% higher than if I just project from February 2020 before the lockdown happened. The confidence bounds are also much wider.

How should I deal with this? How have you folks dealt with this?

Because I am giving my manager two copies of every projection I have. One that uses the lockdown as training data, and one that doesn't.

I have framed it as - here are projections that take into account continued lockdowns and customer uncertainty/  panic buying, and here are the more sane projections that might happen if a  vaccine is found tomorrow and everything gets back to normal.

However I feel like I should be telling them which one to use, or what I have done to ensure we get the most accurate projections.

P.S. I am not even using python or anything complex for this. Just Excel's built in forecasting tool, which is pretty handy. However I'm decent enough at python if you want to recommend something I can do to ""fix"" it.

Edit: after the suggestions below, I went and used prophet and the regressor feature. You can see in the documentation that it's used for some superbowl dates, but i used the lockdown dates. https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/seasonality,_holiday_effects,_and_regressors.html

**To measure predictive accuracy they use:**

10-fold-cross-validation

AUC-ROC

top-decile lift

**To measure robustness(** **ability of a model to deliver stable and reproducible results if the model is run multiple times** **) they use:**

They check the predictive accuracy is robust across all cross validation repetitions.

The check the robustness of the removals effects 'ad' factor across 10 cross validation repetitions

Again - my disconnect is - **How are they validating something for which there is no hard data**?

171,datascience,Is it a bad sign to get technical questions from HR?,"Context: 26, BS in CS, been in industry for about four years, data science role for about three years. Feeling it may be time to move on from my current role. 

Had a job interview today with an HR rep. Said rep asked me about a lot of different technologies; asked me to summarize my DS process, my daily workflow, and then asked me to explain a p val and a couple of basic algorithms. I could tell she was reading off a script and wasn’t actually familiar with the associated technologies (she pronounced “MapReduce” like “May Produce,” as in vegetables you buy in May). She said the hiring manager would review my answers and get back to me. 

In most of the interviews I’ve had in the past, I typically do brief personal evals with HR or a hiring manager and then the technical evaluation comes later in the form of a one-on-one or panel discussion with existing technical resources. I feel like getting asked these questions by HR rather than a technical resource, then immediately funneled to the hiring manager, may be a bad sign. Am I overthinking this?

185,datascience,What kind of data is this? Panel Data? Longitudinal Data? Cross Section Data? Time Series Data?,"I created some fake data that represents the problem I am working with : 

https://imgur.com/a/jWsmulO

In short: Patients arrive at the hospital and have their ""health measurements"" taken. It is also recorded whether they were immediately discharged from the hospital, or if they were required to stay. Given a new patient that enters the hospital and their health measurements are taken, I need to predict the response_variable for this patient - will they be immediately discharged from the hospital, or will they have to stay? 

I have data from the last 50 years. It is obvious, that society, people's health and medicine have changed over the last 50 years (e.g. life expectancy has increased in many parts of the world). Perhaps in 1971, an elderly man who smoked his entire life would have had to stay for a prolonged period in the hospital - but in 2019, he might have been given a new drug that was developed in the last 5 years and then immediately discharged. The big question is : do these macro and micro time dependent trends within the variables need to be taken into account when creating statistical models?

So far, I created a decision tree (C5 algorithm) which completely ignores the ""time"" variable. That is, it is assumed that an elderly man from 1971 who smokes is identical to an elderly man that smokes in 2019. By completely ignoring the ""time"" variable, I was able to create a standard decision tree model that produces good results. I tested this two different ways:

1st way: I trained the decision tree using a random 70% sample of the data, and recorded its performance on the remaining 30% of the data.

2nd way: I kept data from 2019 separate.  I then trained a decision tree using using data from previous years. Then I recorded the performance of the decision tree on 2019's data.

In both tests, the performance of the decision tree was good enough for my requirements.

But is just makes me curious: (looking at the imgur picture) what kind of data do I have? In statistics, is this considered Panel Data? Cross Section Data? Longitudinal Data? Time Series Data?

I have a feeling that is not longitudinal data - as far as I understand, longitudinal data repeatedly records measurements on the same patient   (e.g. once every year). As far as I am concerned, all patients in my data are unique. Perhaps I am dealing with multivariate time series data?

Can someone please help me identify what kind of data this is? And what models are usually used for classifying this kind of data ? 

My model results are good enough as is, but I am still curious.

189,datascience,I am Struggling with My Remote Onboarding,"Hi, I am almost two months into a new job and struggling. 

We are a small team at a large company, all remote and I am in a senior position here. My boss is not technical and I am new to this industry. 

Our data taxonomy is incredibly confusing and is widely understood to be one of the main challenges for anyone joining the team.  I have only had access to our database for about 3 weeks at this point, but my boss expects me to write working code with no supervision or review. 

Occasionally, I have been told to use the wrong table or been given vague directions. When I try to clarify I am given some helpful info usually, but not enough to solve the entire problem. I try to setup calls to walk through things and get another set of eyes on my work so I know I'm on the right path, but that doesn't always happen due to tight deadlines and reduced headcount. I'll have a meeting to go over how to run a query, which is fine, but after I dig into the tables (for the first time) and have new questions it seems like people are confused I didn't ask them at the first meeting. I've had a few miscommunications on top of everything else, almost certainly due to not being in the office together, which is making me look terrible all around. My boss is not happy.  

Are people seeing this in other organizations, or more so than pre-covid? Does it matter if the new hire is junior or senior? I want to do everything I can to course correct, but struggling to understand where things are going wrong. I clearly need more training, so I want to start there."
190,datascience,Career advice on networking and getting a first internship (kind of a desperate rant),"Feel free to shun the post if this is innaprorpriate, but I do consider it a career advice question. 
24 yo here who got into OMSA straight outta undergrad and I have no job experience in the field yet. 

I live in Atlanta and it seems like new data science and analytics jobs are being added every single day. I’ve applied to countless internships and entry level positions and I even make sure my resume and Cover letter is optimized for applicant tracking systems for every job (which ends up taking hours). 

It’s always the same “we’ve selected another candidate” email. I haven’t even recieved an interview yet and I’ve been steadily applying for a year. 

I have a BS in mathematics with a Computer science minor, I’m in the OMSA at Tech where I’m finishing my first year, I have plenty of *non trivial*  ML and analysis problems in my portfolio, I coauthored and performed computational chemistry calculations that landed 3 publications in Elsevier, ASME national proceedings, and Journal of material science, yet the job search is getting so discouraging. 

It seems that cold applying is pointless. You have to basically have someone recommend an interview for you at the company. I don’t know a single soul in the industry. LinkedIn networking is...not working for me to keep it short haha. 

Does any one have any advice or at least some words of encouragement? Meeting new connections is hard during the pandemic. I’m looking at meetup.com and trying to find alternative job sites that aren’t as popular as LinkedIn, so we’ll see. 

It’s getting to the point where I might change career trajectory since DS has turned into such a buzzword and is getting so popular. I’m applying to transfer to GT CSE to specialize in High performance computing and scalability for ML on distributed systems to kind of stand out and stay ahead of the curve. Plus, on campus I can organically meet new people. 

Anyway, thanks for reading all of this and apologies for the whining. It’s just that I’m about to be 25 and I would like to start my career job so I can finally get my life rolling 😭haha.

Edit: I will note that I haven’t taken the coursework that utilizes team based dev projects or the big data systems yet in OMSA. Maybe that will help with networking and finishing up the skill set."
191,datascience,Power BI vs Tableau,"Hello Everyone!

I have used Power BI to build analytical dashboards for a publication for quite some time now. They recently asked whether they should transition to using Tableau since “it’s aesthetically more pleasing”.

I would appreciate some advice on this. I have never used Tableau myself. Are there any specific pros/cons in switching from Power BI to Tableau?"
192,datascience,"What is a ""breakout"" in stock market? I keep googling it and I can't find a statistical concept called a ""breakout"".","My client wants me to get the ""breakout"" of stock shares. I showed him the definition of Breakout on Investopedia and he said that's not it. Never have I ever heard of this concept, and when I ask him ""what's breakout"" he says ""breakout of these numbers"". Please help an ESL speaker understand what he wants. I am well-versed enough in English to take definitions of words for granted. I never looked up the definition of breakout in the dictionary, I just know what it means in the context. But there's zero context here. I'm not really that smart to translate language into mathematics. I noticed he wanted me to get the weighing average of some data, but the formula he gave me eventually after getting it wrong was not at all what weighing average is. There was zero weight involved. I think financial people speak a different language than data sci people. And I really don't want to ask him because he's getting frustrated with my questions.

Especially considering how I fell a class behind because I had to retake a course I was struggling with my first semester. So I just don’t really know what I should do for the upcoming Summer because I want to be able to do something relevant to data science that I can add to my resume for future applications. I’ll keep applying to stuff I believe I am qualified for but any advice or ideas would be great.
195,datascience,Product Placement Lengths,"Sorry if this is in the wrong place; please let me know if it is.

I have products that I send to different companies that service said products for a period of months. Each company receives a fee for providing a service for the product. As a product ages companies can receive a higher fee for services provided after their initial placement period. The product generates revenue when it is placed with a servicer.

I want to examine the appropriate duration of months between when a product moves from one servicer where the fee is lower to a servicer with a higher fee. The goal is to determine a duration where a product stays with a servicer at a lower fee before being moved to a servicer with a higher fee. 

Prior work utilized the mean and sd to include durations that captured between 90% and 97.5% of products based on revenue the product generated. This was an initial look and did not check for normal distributions or skew. There is some seasonality that impacts the revenue generated by the products.

What would be some additional or alternative approaches to analyzing and examining how long a product should be placed in one servicer grouping before being moved to another?

Thanks in advance for your insights and suggestions."
196,datascience,Scenario update - how to interpret?,"So I've been ""running"" our BI department at my job for 2020 by utilizing an external set of consultants who have built our data warehouse and several Tableau reports. Behind the scenes, I've been quietly trying to figure out how to formally enter data science by using it at my company. Today, I had the conversation with my boss, the CFO, that changed everything:

Takeaways:  


1.) I have to continue leading and providing value via analytics, dashboarding, models, etc. He wants the external team producing dashboard that people will use (and he understands the plight most BI people experience building dashboards no one ever uses).

2.) He wants me to focus my time on learning Python so that I can construct models for forecasting, prediction, and analysis. Our company is nowhere near machine learning in production, but it feels this might be the right step? I get to analyze product data, insights, financial/payments data, sales data, market data, etc.

3.) The company will assist in tuition reimbursement for NetMath as well as a masters in computational mathematics with electives in stats/probability. I'm also enrolling in CS courses at a CC alongside NetMath.

4.) He does want me to learn Tableau so that I can perform my own visualizations on the fly, but not be bogged down with the enterprise reporting the external BI team will take over.

This might sound like a dumb question, but these are all good things, yes? Does this set me up into a DS position and career? Fallbacks would be any other form of product/insight analyses, BI, etc. Sound good?"
197,datascience,Advice - Managers/Supervisors where am i going wrong?,"This post is probably not original, but i do feel like the questions may be a little more specific, and since random employers aren’t really bothering to give me feedback i was hoping to hear from some of you on what it is precisely I’m doing wrong or where i can improve.

I am currently looking for a job (mostly) in Canada but i have had very little success in even getting interviews for the past \~6 months graduated from my masters in the field @ UBC in June, and have since only gotten 3 ""introductory"" interviews through connections and recommendations, and non through the standard online application.  


I belive I have the skills and knowledge in the field to land at least a junior job, but as i said, no luck so far, and i suspect part of it is the following 3 things:

I grew up in a foreign country - i get the feeling that if i had exactly the same background but in Canada/US i would have a much easier time (I am a Canadian and American citizen).

 Economics background - I did my undergrad in economics and worked for nearly 3 years at the local Ministry of Finance doing research oriented work. That is in two roles i took on two major projects.

Third is that i may simply not conveying my experience well through my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The first was modelling the efficiency of the financial institutions in the country: relatively small data set from financial reports over the course of some years, DEA regression for relative rankings of these institutions. statistical validity of our models and various iterations (with different targets, and explanatory variables). although it was under the supervision of my boss, i was doing most (almost all) of the work, and calling the shots so long as they weren't too fundamental to the project.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The second i was modelling the cuases of salary change (growth) for government employees, standard regression (MLR), again aside from collecting the data and defining the question i did all of the work i.e wrangling &amp; cleaning, pre-processing, statistical testing etc'.

&amp;#x200B;

Ill only add that during my undergrad about 25% of my credits were math and statistics. And during my masters we had a 2 month capstone project (similar to co-op) working with/for a company along side their DS team on a modelling project feels to me that the title of economics/economist is looked down upon a little by the DS/comp-sci people in particular (one of my masters professors said something to the effect of ""you probably didn't really do anything like this""), whereas to me the differences in methodology are not huge.

&amp;#x200B;

before i wrap this up:

1. I’m fully aware that we are currently in a pandemic, and it is a little unfortunate to be looking for a job at the moment. 
2. I can absolutely be wrong about some or all of my assumptions (which is why I’m writing here).
3. I haven't been applying so much for American jobs as i kind of prefered to remain in Canada recently.
4. I have been very picky with the ""Data Analyst"" roles i have been applying too, as im wary of the ""sort out this excel sheet"" kind of work you may get as an analyst in some jobs (such as commercial bank).

If you actually read all of this, thank you and have a great week"
198,datascience,Do any of you get emotional when looking at some data? And felt like there's nothing you can do about it?,"I'm not sure if it should be on this sub so please let me know if it isn't.

I joined as a data analyst almost three weeks ago (B.Tech in CS) and this is my first 'Real dataset' I'm working on. For this project I have to look for some segment of customers to sell a plan to or change the plan to sell it better to the target audience. 

So I was plotting some graphs and everything was fine until I saw the groups of people according to their class of life, whether they have a loan and if they are interested in taking a loan. The graph broke my heart because a lot of people who earn less and have loans ARE interested in taking another one. And there are some who earn so less that they aren't eligible to take loans but are interested. 

I felt like each of those points were real people, they are. I couldn't stop thinking about those people, how difficult their lives must be, how taking another loan will make it worse for them in the long run. I kept on thinking about what I can do about those people. There's nothing I can do... And it makes me so sad. 

Do any of you feel like this when you end up with data like this? I've never really felt like this and I'm really confused. I don't know what to do or how to help them. Or if I can come up with a new scheme that targets these groups of people which will help them. Is there something I can do? My job is simple, find people to sell something to. Or change that something so people buy it. But this is hard. 

And I tried to get in touch with my mentor but she has been busy and I haven't been able to get a one on one with her yet. 

Any insight will be appreciated. Thank you!

Edit 1:

Thank you for your wonderful insights and thoughts. Indeed, working with data is so amazing. I'd never seen the world this way before and I was taken aback. I will read up more on Machine Learning ethics and also figure out a way to either create a scheme that includes everyone or at least doesn't take advantage of other people. I will do all I can to give back to this world we have. Thank you so much again!

P.S. I think I can see the world a little differently now... And I think I know what I have to do. I'll let you guys know how my meeting tomorrow goes.

Edit 2:
I just finished with my meeting. My manager said we can look for a scheme for the lower section of the society but our primary focus will be those who can take it, that being the middle and upper middle class. So we need not sell it to those who are interested on taking the loan but will have a difficult time repaying it. I'm hopeful that we'll do something good with this.

I was told to not talk about it in the client meeting in a few days (the lead will deal with it) and that I should work on improving the scheme and they'll have someone figure out something for the other clusters. And that we should exclude this entire section of the sample all together from our target audience. 

I think I'll work on this on the side in my free time too though. Just in case I come up with something good. 

Thanks a lot again for sharing your experiences and pointing me to such wonderful resources! www.datakind.irg/do-good-with-data was especially amazing! I really hope I'm able to contribute to the cause. 

Hope all of you have an amazing time. I love you guys so much.

199,datascience,"Data Science Degree/Career on the line, please help!","Sooo I’m a masters of DS student with around a year and a half work experience as a Business analyst and data analyst. My undergrad was Business Info Systems.

None of these jobs were fulfilling for me and after contemplating for many years/months, I decided to return to school to complete a Ms in Data Science. 

I have completed one semester in a top 100 school (world) which has no prerequisites and anyone with a bit of cash can pay to get in. I did extremely well and have transferred to a top 30 school which has a seemingly strict selection process with a renowned  stats school. I have just completed my first semester at the top 30 school. 

Long story short - I feel like I’m not ready for this course. Specifically, the one at the top 30 school. I don’t have a statistics or mathematics background nor a strong programming/computer science background. And the courses I’ve taken this semester have relied HEAVILY on prerequisite undergrad units like linear algebra, calculus, probability, algorithms, data structures in which I’ve only had an introduction to from starting my Ms at the top 100 school. 

I was planning to quit work to focus on school full time next year but am worried that doing so would bear no fruits, especially if I fail units due to the persisting lack of “common knowledge” for some of these subjects. I wanted to learn EVERYTHING i require over the Christmas break which is around 3 months. 

Any advice DATA scientists?! Is it possible to learn all undergrad math/cs prereqs to a point of comprehension within 3 months so that I can comfortably learn Data Science and compete with my peers?! I just want a good wam with solid fundamentals so I can cop an internship and excel. 

Or is it just simply an impossible task in which I’ll need to do many more years of studying to catch up.  

Any pointers will be appreciated. Thanks all!

204,datascience,First Year As A Data Scientist Reflection,"It's wild to think it's been a year since I first became a data scientist, and I wanted to share some of the lessons I've learned so far.

**1. The Data Science Title Is Meaningless**

I still have no idea what a ""typical"" data scientist is, and many companies have no idea either. A data science role is very dependent on the company and the maturity of their data infrastructure. Instead of a title, focus on what business problems are present for a particular company and how your skillset in data can solve it. Want to build data products? Then chase those business problems! Interested in using deep learning? Find companies with the infrastructure and problems that warrant such methods. Chasing data problems instead of titles will put you in a better place.

**2. Ask More Questions Before Coding**

I've been burned a few times learning that most non-data people have no idea what data solution they need. Jumping straight into coding after getting a request will set you up for failure. Take a step back and ask probing questions for further clarification. Many times you will find that someone will ask for ""ABC"" but after further questions they actually need ""XYZ"". This skill of getting clarity and consensus among stakeholders, regarding data problems and solutions, is such an important facet of being an effective data scientist.

**3. Prototype to Build Buy In**

Start with a simple example, get feedback, implement feedback, then repeat. This process saves you time and makes your stakeholders feel heard/valued. For example, I recently had to create an algorithm to classify our product's users. Rather than jumping straight into python, I created a slide deck describing the algorithms logic visually and an excel spreadsheet of different use cases. I presented these prototypes to stakeholders and then implemented their feedback into the prototype. By the end of this process it was clear as to what I needed to code and the stakeholders understood what value my data solution would bring to them.

**4. Talk to Domain Experts**

You end up making A LOT of assumptions about the data. Talking to domain experts of your data subject and or product will help you make better assumptions. Go talk to Sales or Customer Success teams to learn about customer pain points. Talk to engineers to learn why certain product decisions were made. If it's a specific domain, talk to a subject matter expert to learn whether there is an important nuance about the data or if it's a data quality issue.

**5. Learn Software Engineering Best Practices**

Notebooks are awesome for experimenting and data exploration, but they can only take you so far. Learn how to build scripts for your data science workflow instead of just using notebooks. Take advantage of git to keep track of your code. Write unit tests to make sure your code is working as expected. Put effort into how you structure your code (e.g. functions, separate scripts, etc.). This will help you stand out as a data scientist, as well as make it way easier to put your data solutions into production.

There is probably more, but these are the topics top of mind for me right now! Would love to hear what other data scientist have learned as well!"
205,datascience,Help Interpreting the Results of Graph Community Detection (sorry for my bad drawings in ms paint!)," 

The computer I am using for work does not have internet access or a usb port, so I had to draw how the results looked like.

I am working on a graph network problem with data (\~8000 observations) in this format (this is not my real data, I just simulated some data to show the general structure) - here is the code used to simulate some fake data and draw a graph network: [https://shrib.com/#Bowen2pBKK53](https://shrib.com/#Bowen2pBKK53)

After the graph is created, if I run the following code :

COMP = components(graph)

table(COMP$membership)

I get something that looks like this: (1,50); (2,49); (4;44); (25,39); (16,33); (3;32)... (1239,6); (1615,6);(2536,6); ...(518,5); (519,5)

Based on these results, does it make sense to continue ""community detection""? Or does the distribution look too sparse?

Furthermore, running the following code:

max(GC\_CL$membership) returns a value of ""1""

If I run the following code for Louvain Community Detection (when membership &gt; 3000, a big number!): [https://shrib.com/#Michael2Y5gOXl](https://shrib.com/#Michael2Y5gOXl)

I get an output that looks like this (my ms paint drawing) that looks like this: [https://imgur.com/a/ewA2Qux](https://imgur.com/a/ewA2Qux)

I know this is a very abstract question: for when the number of membership is &gt; 3000, you can see the an output similar to the ms paint picture I drew. Is this indicative of a high degree of separation? Is this indicative of noise?

Could someone please provide some guidance? Or should I just ran Graph Query Language commands (e.g. create subgraphs, examine paths, connectivity, etc.)?

Thanks!"
206,datascience,How Can I Find Out if I would Enjoy A Data Science Career?,"Hello All!  I have read the wiki, but please delete this if it is inappropriate or breaks the rules.  

I've been interested in working with data and data analysis since I undertook a project at an old job where I single-handedly put about 3 years of data into excel and analyzed it in order to improve business practices.  

I found it really exciting and empowering, so I decided to look more into data science careers.  Obviously a lot of programming is involved and I don't have any experience with that although I've started to teach myself Python3.

My question is pretty simple.  I'm thinking about going to grad school to study data science, but I don't really know if I enjoy the nuts and bolts of the work.  How can I find out if I would enjoy this type of work?  Is there anything that I'm overlooking here?"

I've taken every data science/machine learning class I can that the school offers (some of which I took with grad students) so I thought that by the time I was applying to full time data science positions, I would be competitive with other applicants. Since all the positions are so broad, I've been forced to more or less shotgun my resume out to as many companies as possible, sometimes applying to 20+ jobs a week. Any time I can meet a recruiter face to face, I always get an interview, but since applying online, I haven't gotten to a single first round.

I feel like I'm qualified for many of the jobs that I apply for and since they say ""Bachelors required, Masters preferred"" I tend to think I have a believable shot. I've been on this sub long enough to know that finding a data science job nowadays is pretty difficult but if anyone wants to throw me their two cents, I'd be happy to hear it.

222,datascience,Where are the best places to get answers to technical questions on data science?,"I understand this subreddit is not interested in becoming a technical Q and A board (rule 7), but I'm finding Stack Overflow to have a rather disappointing level of engagement with data science questions (in particular mine, of course). For example, the hdbscan tag only has 40 questions attached to it and many questions have a very small number of views on them. The dbscan tag is much better, with 475 questions, many of them with tens of thousands of views.

Other subreddits such as /r/rust seem to welcome questions (possibly partly due to the fact that Stack Overflow has a bit of a Rust problem: [https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/jb3ukm/we\_need\_to\_talk\_about\_stackoverflow/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/jb3ukm/we_need_to_talk_about_stackoverflow/) )

223,datascience,What is the difference between training error and in-sample error ? (Elements of Statistical Learning),"In the book [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) in Chapter 7 (sub-chapter 7.4), the training error (formula 7.17) and in-sample error (7.18) are treated as different concept.

It also mentions that expected value of training error is usually smaller than in-sample error.

I am very confused. Formulas doesn't seem to help me, as for me it seems training error=in-sample error, but I guess I am wrong and I don't understand why.

234,datascience,"A whole year from now to start applying to DS jobs. I'm in a good situation. I can choose what skills to improve, and I'm sure your advice will be super helpful.","Hello everyone, I'm Julian, I have a PhD in physics and I started learning DS about 6 months ago. I'm not a native english speaker (sorry for any mistake). I'm now in a postdoc position for 1.5 more years, but I KNOW that I will quit doing research when this position finishes and I will migrate exclusively to Data Science.  I am a specialist in Sustainable Energy Planning, and I love the topic, so it will be my goal to apply DS to that area of expertise (not necessarily, but would be amazing).

The things is, I have a whole year from now to continue specializing in DS, which is great, and I would love to read your opinion on what I should focus.

So far, I finished the following courses/specializations:

* Machine Learning (Coursera, Andrew NG).
* Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera, [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai)).
* Python for everybody Specialization (Coursera, U. Michigan).
* Applied DS with Python Specialization (Coursera, U. Michigan).

So I have a good theoretical understanding of the algorithms and why they work (mostly).

Projects:

* I applied a K-means algorithm to help a collegue distribute power bioplants across the area of our State, optimizing transport costs (Weiszfeld) and it works pretty well (it is one of the simplest algorithms out there anyway).
* I'm about to get a huge database of energy consumption (lots of variables) and climate variables from a town nearby. I will have some fun with that.

Next steps:

* I'm about to specialize a little more on SQL.
* I'm planning to do the Tensor Flow Specialization of Coursera.
* I will definetly re-learn some statistical concepts that I haven't used for a while.
* I should learn a lot more of Keras.

The doubts I have are:

* Should I learn R?
* Spark?
* Hadoop?
* Java?
* Scala?
* Tableau?
* AWS?
* Azure?
* Should I learn a lot more of Linux? I don't feel very comfortable working on scripts. Simply because I never had the neccesity to do so at large scale.

Of course, I will develop some personal projects, such as the mentioned above, but if you had to choose, what kind of projects would you focus on during this year?

THANKS A LOT! And I'm sorry for such along post."
235,datascience,How normative is this case study of DS interviews?,"What up everybody? So I'm currently a Senior Data Analyst at a Fortune 50 company and interviewing for an Associate Data Scientist position internally. Thus far, I had a 15ish minute touchbase with a manager on the team and just got sent the case study. This thing is pretty hefty. We're given a week to do it, and are expected to present our code/modeling as well as a presentation deck. The email they sent said explicitly it should take a decent amount of time hence the week time allowance.

I'll be honest and say that I'm mildly considering withdrawing. I have some preliminary ideas just glancing over the case, but my job is hectic right now, I'm in my second semester of grad school, and wedding planning. If it was a 2 hour analytical assessment or something (he also mentioned that a paper analytical/SQL assessment would follow) that would be one thing, but am finding it hard to motivate myself to spend a solid amount of my free time plugging away at this for the next week. Maybe it's just this busy season of my life.

238,datascience,Best python packages for marketing / customer / transaction datasets? I have added some of my own suggestions. Looking for more.,"As part of my job I'm swamped in transaction &amp; customer data all day. This has led me to seek out python packages that are suited to these sorts of datasets. Here's what I've found. Would love some more recommendations if there are any.

My data basically looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

**Transactions**

&amp;#x200B;

|customer\_id|store|spend|date|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|xyz456|KFC|$20|02/02/2020|
|abc23|McDonalds|$50|01/01/2020|

&amp;#x200B;

**Customer Data**

&amp;#x200B;

|customer\_id|address|age|gender|other\_demographics|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|xyz456|12 Main Street|23|M|estimated wealth info etc.|
|abc23|15 Other Street|34|F|census info etc.|

&amp;#x200B;

And I've found the following packages that suit data like this:

&amp;#x200B;

**Lifetimes**

Churn analysis, predict number of purchases, predict customer lifetime value. The number of purchases and lifetime value aren't very accurate in my tests. Churn analysis is pretty good and extremely lightweight and simple.

[https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes)

&amp;#x200B;

**ML Extend**

I've used it for Association Rule mining. It's used to find shopping patterns i.e. eggs are often bought with flour and milk.

I've re-jigged it to find common demographic patterns in relation to stores. e.g. McDonalds customers are often 24 year old males.

[http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Facebook Prophet**

Time Series forecasting.

Not really impressed with time series in general. I can usually just draw an upwards trending line on the chart with crayon and get the same result. Or the time series can predict a boost in sales during Christmas. But I knew that already as it happens every year. Although I've never really studied time series in great detail. Just playing along with the documentation.

[https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick\_start.html#python-api](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api)

&amp;#x200B;

**RFM Modeling**

Segment your customers based on how much they spend, how often and how recently. Useful for finding your ""champion"" customers, or people who may be slipping away into churning and need attention.

[https://github.com/zark-stark12/crm-rfm-modeling](https://github.com/zark-stark12/crm-rfm-modeling)

&amp;#x200B;

**Implicit**

Recommender system. Seems to work well. Quite good at finding similar stores / products. e.g. give it deliveroo and it will spit out other take away fast food companies and .. Netflix? Pizza and movie night maybe? Some interesting results.

[https://github.com/benfred/implicit](https://github.com/benfred/implicit)

&amp;#x200B;

239,datascience,Today I learned about the magical number 30 and the cult following of CLT that praises it,"Hopefully this is a reprieve from all the distraught people looking for professional advice.

I'm at the beginning of my earnest DS journey and I'm attempting to learn core mathematics and statics again, this time wearing my ""big boy"" pants. You know, actually thinking critically instead of regurgitating facts.

So my program is acquainting me with the Central Limit Theorem and has all these ""knowledge check"" questions which basically force to you to pick answers that align with the assumption that your sample size must be greater than 30 for the CLT to apply. I was confused by this because 30 seemed terribly arbitrary. 

After some googling, I found that this ""magical number 30"" is indeed based on almost nothing--maybe some very general observations that most likely don't apply to your situation--yet it is a collective delusion that we keep passing down from 101 textbook to 101 textbook. In [this forum discussion](https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_rationale_behind_the_magic_number_30_in_statistics) about the issue, I found this wonderful ""religious creed"" dedicated to the CLT that I just needed to share:

&gt;""We believe in one Holy, All Powerfully Robust, and inviolate Central Limit Theorem. We acknowledge one and only one True Distribution, begotten of the Central Limit Theorem, and through this Normal Distribution are all populations of interest made. For us and for our fellow researchers, all samples of psych 101 students are representative of any population of interest through the power of the Central Limit Theorem. We pray that the Holy Normal Distribution generalize our data with the grace and of the Divine Central Limit Theorem."" 

I didn't expect to actually LOL when reading about statistics. 

Anyways, hope this makes someone laugh!"

253,datascience,Meaning of the math behind Principal Component Analysis,"Hey, 

So I'm a fresher to datascience and lately I've been catching up on principal component analysis (PCA) and the math behind it. For anyone who is well versed in Linear Algebra, i have a question that's been itching in me. Now i know PCA is used to increase the Signal to Ratio, basically the information fed into our data. But the way to do so is little unclear. 

Firstly I went through the link [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mathematics-behind-principal-component-analysis-fff2d7f4b643) to understand what was happening. As a beginner in Linear Algebra, I understand what eigenvectors and eigenvalues are. Let me try to define it below, please let me know if I'm thinking straight:

&gt;Eigenvector is one, who when undergoing a Linear transformation through a matrix A will not change its orientation but only will be scaled by the eigenvalue. 

So in this aspect I was checking PCA, when it was mentioned we try to find the eighen vectors for Linear transformation given by the Covariance Matrix. Now this is where I have a hard time understanding the concept. Why are we seeing Covariance Matrix as a linear transformation, how does finding a vector that does not change its orientation and finding the eigenvalue help us here?

What are we trying to achieve by doing that? And is there any benefits in learning this particular mathematical concept? Or is it better to just leave it as it be and mug the concept?

I'd love some help as I'm unaware who to raise this question to. Hopefully I could find some help here. 

If its the wrong place to raise, please guide me as to where I can do so?

Thanks Reddit!"

258,datascience,"Seriously, how am I expected to grow in a profession where everyone discourages me from building anything non-trivial","**TL;DR:** switched from software engineering to data science 3 years ago looking for a more challenging career. Have had zero technical growth since then. Looking for a way out.

Myself: in my late 20s, started my career as a software engineer (2 YOE), then did a Masters in DS and since then have spent another 3 years as a data scientist (had one job in a mid-size startup and another one in a late-stage startup).

As a SWE, I wanted to switch to data science to have a more intellectually stimulating and rewarding job. Somehow I had this idea that DS would make it possible for me to pair my SWE skills with passion for maths, and I was really looking forward to lots of technical growth and exciting projects. Thinking now that this may have been my biggest career mistake so far as it's been the exact opposite.

Every single senior colleague I've been working with has been explicitly discouraging me from building anything more complex than a logistic regression, and usually suggested that I should implement some simple SQL / if-else solution instead. In fact, 90% of my job has always been data lackey work answering silly ad-hoc questions from stakeholders using SQL or basic pandas. I feel like I haven't learned anything in the last 3 years except for tons of non-transferrable domain knowledge that I deeply don't care about.

I totally get it that as a data scientist, I am expected to provide business value - and not build fancy models. It is just that I no longer see how I can pair being useful with having at least some benefits for my career and technical growth.

I once had this guy on my team who was complaining a lot about DS applicants he was interviewing back then. His problem was with them mentioning ""passion for neural networks"" on their CVs and not being ""down to earth"" enough. The guy then went on to change teams, work as a front-end developer and learn all the fancy React stuff, and then switched teams again to do backend engineering, learn yet another language and use his new skills to tackle some really cool problems.

Like wow, it almost feels as if people in this industry sincerely believe it is okay for a software engineer to keep learning and have lots of technical growth, whereas a data scientist is expected to know their place and be stuck doing SQL / occasionally treat themselves to some very basic ML.

I guess there are some DS positions out there that are not like that but they seem to be incredibly rare, and it feels like every year of this sort of ""experience"" makes it less and less likely for me to ever get into real ML as the market feels so competitive.

I am thinking that I should go back to software engineering while it's not too late. Have some of you guys been in a similar position? What do you think?"
260,datascience,Is Julia viable for DS now?,"Version 1.5.2 seems to have come a long way from a year back when I first used Julia in a class. 

I just looked into DataFramesMeta and it pretty much has whatever I need from the tidyverse along with DataFrames for groupby and combine(groupby(()) 

The packages I use mainly have been 
GLM, MixedModels (although for GLMMs I use R), DataFrames, DataFramesMeta, RCall, Distributions, StatsBase/Statistics, MultivariateStats, Lasso/glmnet, Plots (also usually call ggplot2), Clustering, DecisionTrees. In terms of statistical libraries Julia may be ahead of Python except for probably GAMs (Python has PyGAM) which you have to call out to R mgcv for. 

Then there is parallel computing which is actually pretty easy to use with Distributed, SharedArrays, and ParallelDataTransfer. 

DataFrames with DataFramesMeta seem to work in an intuitive manner unlike Pandas, more directly similar to dplyr (and there is an equivalence chart on the github docs). The macros @where, @select, @transform pretty much work like dplyr does (but no piping) however you can use the @linq macro syntax to do the piping.

Also using the “.” with a function like f.() in order to vectorize it I really like, and if you do end up having to use a loop the speed penalties are not as bad. 

Modules have also been nice for projects to keep functions nicely organized in your own library.

Seems to cover most everyday things I do. And functional programming has been a lot easier for me than the OOP and def __init__() and self() and super() crap that Python has. 

I have really been liking the structs concept and it kind of addresses a weakness with R in how the S3/S4 system can be hard to learn. Code is way cleaner and using structs really helps abstraction, which is useful when its been a while since you looked at something and forgot the details. And for me OOP is just too confusing and unintuitive from a stats background. Its not how I think at all.

Its also very very easy to use RCall to get that one stats method from R you need."

Recurrence relations and writing expressions of for and while loops to understand the runtime of them and do big O and omega analysis. Anyways, I’ve found out I am very bad at this stuff, and well legitimately failed a midterm with it. So my question is, how much runtime analysis is asked in data science interviews?

264,datascience,Where to start,"Disclaimer up front: I'm not a data scientist, I'm an analyst who has some programming knowledge and knows how to turn data into pretty graphs and metrics in PowerBI, excel, and access.

I've been struggling in two areas in my efforts to move away from manually importing and reducing my data. The first is importing the data, i have a lot of data coming in different formats and table structures, but largely the same information. If I had a UI that could read a file, ask the user to identify specific fields on the first import, and from then on  import with a ""one button press"", that would be super helpful. Currently I use Access saved imports, but those are a pain to set up, break easily, and have to be set up individually for each new data source.

Which brings me to the second area that I've struggled with. I've been using various incarnations of a split access database as both the UI for data entry and data storage. I have no idea what the best database/UI solution is, but I know access isn't it.

I'll take any advice I can get. Thanks"

- Dashboard development, internal and external

I use SAS, R, SQL and Tableau. Currently learning Python to supplement all of the above, and obviously developing my domain knowledge. 

My question is this: with this kind of experience (let’s say I work at this or similar role for 5 years), will not having a masters degree be a roadblock? I believe I got insanely lucky getting this job with no prior experience and only a bachelors, so I’m not sure how my resume will look if I were to look for a job elsewhere a few years down the line.

I'm trying to set up a process that scrapes a website once a week, stores the data in a database. I will then use the scraped data to develop a model and ultimately build a little web app that makes predictions. 

I have already made the web scraper, I have built a Flask API before, and I know how to do the modeling. What I don't understand is how to set up the database to be persistent and hosted? I have the scraper working and writing to a postgres database locally, but I am struggling to figure out how to move this local process to a hosted environment. 

I would ideally like to use AWS to get experience using AWS. I am not working with very much data (thousands of observations) and I am not opposed to paying a small amount monthly for the services.

I have researched AWS S3 and I understand that this is basic storage. But I dump a postgres database there I can't actually connect to it can I?

I know that AWS has a RDS service, is this what people normally use? I basically just want to be able to pull data and write to a database hosted online somewhere rather than storing everything locally. All the tutorials I read always gloss over this step. Either the data isn't suppose to be persistent or they just ignore this part and describe the API building and deployment.

I kind of feel like I am missing something obvious but basically if I want to have a postgres db hosted on the cloud somewhere what is the best approach for this?"

However, I have never used the tool ""SQL Reporting Services"" and I am wondering if I should learn it or focus on BI tools like Power BI?

I wanted to build up data science skills because I think there can be significant opportunities to improve public policy analysis through data science. I wanted a resource that could help me build a foundation in python and R and so I eventually just opted for DataQuest after seeing some reviews on here. I have now just about finished the python fundamentals course. 

Overall I got to say I love it, the exercises build on each other really well and everything gets wrapped up with a project that uses all the skills you learned. What I love most though is the newsletter that comes out regularly and the community forum. The newsletter always provides great articles and sometimes data or projects people in the community have worked on. Whenever I had a question, you can easily and automatically post to the forum and the answers I received were always fast and phenomenal. Doing the courses, reading the newsletter, and participating in the forum really helps you to feel like you are being educated and not just doing exercises. 

The price can be steep, but they almost always offer a 50% off price at multiple times in the year. I got a multiple year subscription because I work full time and also have other commitments so I knew it would take me a while to get through all the content. If you're interested I highly recommend you give it a try when they have a 50% off sale. You can also use my referral link if you want another $15 off.

295,datascience,How do I approach this document extraction problem?," I am thinking of training a model to automatically extract information from more or less structured documents like invoices.

Here are the main challenges regarding this task:

1. In fact, even though invoices are often called ""structured"" documents, there is a lot of variance in their layouts depending on the field, company, and other factors, which makes it almost impossible to achieve great results with pattern matching.
2. When relying on text, the most straightforward solution to get textual information from documents is using an OCR engine like Tesseract or EasyOCR (or, probably, commercial solutions from Google, Amazon, Microsoft). Unfortunately, more often than not, outputs from OCR libraries are rather dirty, which can be explained by the quality of scans.
3. Some fields can appear in a document multiple times. This is especially true for line items
4. Some values might belong to several classes (entities) at the same time. For example, extracting addresses, company names is definitely not a one-to-one mapping in that several companies are mentioned with the corresponding addresses and other types of information.

That said, what could you recommend as a possible approach to this problem? I understand that given (1)-(4) there is no way I should expect a perfect solution, but at least something that would at least make sense to try.

My current thoughts:

* This problem has a lot of similarity with traditional NER-like tasks, but those are most often trained on sentenced where there's a lot of semantical value and not just key/value pairs.
* I am almost 100% certain that without some rules, even some hardcoded ones, it will be extremely difficult to get something useful. One such idea is to use a pre-trained NER model, extract standard entities like MONEY, DATE, COMPANY, etc, and then just look in the neighborhood of these entities (in terms of coordinates, I mean) to check whether phrases like Total amount  
or Invoice date  
are nearby.
* Probably, it makes sense to use both bounding boxes and text values for labeling and further model building. On the other hand, it would be quite challenging to do that labeling because some entities might change their location from document to document, span over several lines, etc.

What should I read/try to have a better understanding of how to approach this problem?

Thanks in advance!"

299,datascience,I'm deploying my first data science app...need help determining my cloud stack,"Hi all, I recently posted about my initial experience with deploying an XGBoost predictive model. After some reflection I realized that I have no idea what my cloud architecture looks like! So I wanted to get your opinions about what technologies I need to realize this app. Here are its features:

1. Users input either: details about an apartment; or a Craigslist link
2. Details are preprocessed and converted to a feature vector
3. An XGBoost model predicts the price of the rental unit
4. The prediction is served to the user
5. Data is scraped from Craigslist's most recent daily results, and added to a datastore
6. The XGBoost model is retained with the new data each day (via batch processing)

I am interested in leveraging AWS's resources to deploy this app. My questions right now are:

1. Right now the data exists in a pickled dataframe (glorified spreadsheet). There is a field in the raw data that is a list of dictionaries, and I don't know how that would be supported in a RDBMS. Do I need to offshore my data to a database, or is there something more lightweight that I can use to house my data? Keep in mind there is no relational data in this project, it basically uses one spreadsheet.
2. Can I use a Docker Container to deploy my app based on the features above?
3. What do I use to host my front end? S3? ec2? Is the front end part of the container and is included in the Fargate/ECS part of the stack?

So...I have kind of a weird question that’s bothering me for a while now and it just recently came back to me.

What’s the difference between the IDEs from Jetbrains?
It might sound ridiculous but...they all look similar. They all seem to often support the same plugins and even other languages (can use Java, R or Julia in like IntelliJ or Pycharm for example).

I have Webstorm, Pycharm, and IntelliJ installed. And I have no idea why. When I code in PyCharm for example and my project contains an HTML/CSS/JS file (a django project for example) then I just...I just edit it. With full syntax highlighting and everything. So why would I even open up WebStorm?!

And - if I was actually an PHP dev - why would I use WebStorm if I had their PHP IDE? I mean don’t they both feature CSS, HTML, and JS?
Is their PHP IDE just WebStorm + PHP?!

I think you know where I am going here.
While this sounds hilarious, it’s a real question I am asking myself. For example if I want to code R. Or SQL. Or a Django Project. There are various IDEs I can install plugins in to make them work but...which to choose and why?!

Thanks for your input.


Side question: Pycharm needs a „project“-structure to work, right? If I work on something we do on GitHub I keep cluttering our project with these pycharm generated files which annoys other dev‘s.

Well, a couple weeks ago I signed up for a competition from one of the big companies in my country for their Big Data school. The entry test was really rough (tens of thousadns of missing values, hashed data with about 5k values) I attempted it last year and failed spectacularly, and although I passed it this time I failed at the next stages of the selection process where I was asked a lot about how I tackled certain problems with the dataset. I realised that I didn't even think about a lot of these problems and I only did some pretty basic data cleaning. It's clear to me that at this stage, this is my biggest weak point.

What do you feel is the best way to learn it? I want to get in and do some actual practice with datasets, but I'm pretty intimidated right now. I would appreciate any advice and thanks in advance.

318,datascience,"is there a way to ""unclutter"" a ""crowded"" network graph?"," 

Recently, I have started learning how to use the 'igraph' library in R for creating graph networks. I created an example which shows some sort of ""relationship"" between groups of people (e.g. personA sells a car to PersonB, PersonB sells a car to PersonC, PersonC cells a car to personB). Eventually, I would like to run graph based clustering on this kind of data (e.g. what is the shortest path between two people, is there a relation between two people, etc.).

Here is the fake data (the numbers correspond to each person's ID) I created and the resulting graph:

library(igraph)

\#create first file

x5 &lt;- sample(1:100, 50, replace=T)

\#create second file

x4 &lt;- sample(1:100, 50, replace=T)

\#combine files

a = cbind(x4,x5)

\#convert to data frame

a = data.frame(a)

\#convert to factor

a$x4 = as.factor(a$x4)

\#convert to factor

a$x5 = as.factor(a$x5)

\#convert to matrix

a = as.matrix(a)

\#create graph

graph\_object = graph\_from\_edgelist(a)

\#plot graph

plot(graph\_object)

This is what I had wanted, but I have one problem. In my actual data, there are thousands of people and theirs ID's are several numbers long. This means, when I run the following code on more people with longer ID's, the resulting graph becomes so cluttered and crowded, it becomes impossible to read.

Here is an example that is closer to my situation:

library(igraph)

library(dplyr)

\#create file from which to sample from

x5 &lt;- sample(1:1000000000, 2000, replace=T)

\#convert to data frame

x5 = as.data.frame(x5)

\#create first file (take a random sample from the created file)

Is it possible to change the output of this graph so that it becomes easier to read? I started reading about the ""forced graph layout"", but I am not sure if this will help. I see that there are other network/graph visualization packages in R, such as ""visNetwork"" - could this be used to unclutter the graph? Is it possible to ""hide"" the ID's in the output, i.e. the ID is displayed when you move the mouse cursor over the nodes, or appear when you click on the node? Or are there mathematical limitations to the number of nodes that can be displayed?

319,datascience,Treating Every Modeling Problem as a End-to-End Neural Net,"Hi, I am wondering of the opinions on end to end modeling.

Many recent ideas in the ML community (like MIT, Stanford, etc)  , and on AI videos have seemed to shun the feature selection and feature engineering layers of data science.

Example:    ""End to end will always beat engineered approaches"" - George Hotz

I think this thinking comes from image recognition and using CNNs as the modeling instead of traditional image feature engineering.   Do CNNs always beat in every image recognition case?

I am seeing this way of thinking creep into various industries and dont think it should be generalized to all modeling....  much energy I think is being wasted on building large over-fitted models.

What is everyones thoughts on this?  Should every problem be treated as an image problem?"
320,datascience,Social Science PhD Candidate on the Brink of Quiting. What are my DS Job Prospects like? How can I improve them?,"Hi All,

I'm a 4th year PhD student in political science at a top 10 university in my field. I'm hitting that stage in my program where I am highly questioning whether it is for me, whether I like it, and whether I'm cut out for it. I have few circulating papers but the publish or parish mentality is getting to me.

Also, truth is, I kind of just prefer coding in R. That is my favorite part of the job usually. I'm happier when I am RAing for a professor who tells me ""here, do X,Y,Z, merge these data sets, run this analysis, and summarize what you find for me"" than I am reading poli sci work, doing my own research, and dealing with reviewers.   


  
I'm relatively fluent with R and have a foundational understanding of advanced statistics but I am not methodologist. I can merged datasets, aggregate and summarize data, run regressions and generalized linear models (and understand outputs), design quasi-experiments like DiDs and regression discontinuety designs, know when to adjust SEs, cluster, etc. I know some basic text-anlysis including how to use cosign-similarity scores and supervised learning methods (a bit of unsupervised methods but not much as to how it works). I'm definetly not developing R packages yet though.

I also know a fair amount of GIS in R and through ArcGIS. I've dipped my toes in Python but only for certain specfici uses (needed certain packages that predict race/ethnicity and to parse certain file types). I don't really know SQL but it does not seem to hard to learn.

I have 2 years of work experience in a non-profit foundation.

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping for some career advice. If I do make the call to not pursue academia at all (I'm like 90% of the way there), what can I do to improve my chances at a data science/marketing analytics type of role. Options I am considering:

* Finishing my PhD quick and dirty. My committee is generally friendly and I think they would understand if I just wanted to be done and submitted a mediocer dissertation. I could do this in about 9 months. 
* Drop out now. Look for a job with what I got. Seems like a terrible idea during the middle of a pandemic though.
* Stay in the program for now. Continue to get my stipend/TA for living funds. Do a coding/ data science bootcamp and leave after that is done (learn SQL and maybe Python + industry specifics not learned in academia).  

* Stay in the program for now. Work torwards the PhD. Apply to jobs while staying in the program. State in my letters that I am interested in a career switch. If some thing good comes up, make the jump. Otherwise,   


Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should do to improve my chances of landing a job? Do I have decent chance of landing an industry job with my skill set? I'm not super picky about the exact industry though I would prefer something not in a ""moral questions"" sector (military/oil/etc). I am currently living in Los Angeles and open to relocation at any major US city, preferably on the West coast.   


Thanks!"
321,datascience,Learning curve of R after coming from python?,"I’m a college student in my local university, majoring in statistics. I’ve got a opportunity to work on some statistical research for a professor at a department at my university. I come from a python background and have been doing all my personal data science projects in python. However I was told by the professor that I’d have to pick up R because apparently all academic research regarding statistical analysis is done in R rather than python. R has more statistical benefits as opposed to python according to him. Anyways, that’s not the point but I was wondering for any of you who learned python previously and went to learn R, how steep was the learning curve? I’d assume it’s harder to go from R to python (and what I’ve read on some subs) is that going from a statistical based language to pure OOP language like python had its challenges, hence the transition from python to R should be easier. But nonetheless, I want to hear your guys thoughts."

323,datascience,Is the job searching process really that bad?,"I read  [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/jk9uy4/stop_giving_extra_tests_filling_out_lengthy/) yesterday and it scared me.

I'm currently a PhD student in physics. Lately I've been unsure if a career as a research scientist in academia/government is right for me. I just passed my qualifying exam and was awarded my MSc. Lately I have been entertaining the idea of leaving my PhD program with my master's, attending a data science bootcamp, and then searching for data science jobs in the London area.

However after reading tales of people who seem like qualified applicants having to submit hundreds of applications only to receive a handful of responses and only a single job offer (if that) make me unsure of whether a career-switch would be a good idea, especially given the fact that I'll be applying to jobs in a new city with a degree in a different field to the jobs that I'll be applying to.

Does anyone have any anecdotes of the job searching process going more smoothly than yesterday's thread would have me believe is common?

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies everyone. I have decided that I definitely don't want to go into data science. Lol"
324,datascience,Does anyone have any experience using 'ggforce' or 'networkd3' in R to create Sankey Diagrams?,"Recently, I have been learning about Sankey Diagrams and have been trying to recreate them in R ([https://rpubs.com/dmormandy/DV\_Sankey](https://rpubs.com/dmormandy/DV_Sankey)).

Here is my imaginary problem: I have a list of people with their first name, middle name and last name. They have common names and their names repeat. I am trying to make a 3 layer (each name is a layer) Sankey Diagram that shows how the names become more unique when you go to the middle name and last name. E.g. there are many ""John's"", but there is only one ""John Claude Frank"".

Here is the fake data I created:

library(networkD3) library(dplyr)

    name_data &lt;- data.frame(     ""City"" = c(""Paris"", ""Paris"", ""Paris"", ""Paris"", ""Paris"", ""London"", ""London"", ""London"", ""Paris"", ""London"", ""Paris""),   ""First_Name"" = c(""John"", ""John"", ""John"", ""John"", ""John"", ""John"", ""James"", ""James"", ""Adam"", ""Adam"", ""Henry""), ""Middle_Name"" = c(""Claude"", ""Claude"", ""Claude"", ""Smith"", ""Smith"", ""Peters"", ""Stevens"", ""Stevens"", ""Ford"", ""Tom"", ""Frank""), ""Last Name "" = c(""Tony"", ""Tony"", ""Frank"", ""Carson"", ""Phil"", ""Lewis"", ""Eric"", ""David"", ""Roberts"", ""Scott"", ""Xavier"") 

) From here, I understand that you need to create a ""links"" object and a ""nodes"" object which will be used to specify the relationships between the names. For the time being, I tried to create an additional column (in Microsoft Excel) that counts the total number of times each name appears in a given column, and then places that number beside the said name. But I don't think this is the right way to solve this problem.

I tried to accomplish this in R, but I don't think I am doing it right:

    dats_all &lt;- name_data %&gt;%                                                   # data     group_by( First_Name, Middle_Name, Last.Name.) %&gt;%  # group them     summarise(Freq = n())                                    # add frequencies 

I found this website over here and I am trying to recreate it with my data: [https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/reference/geom\_parallel\_sets.html](https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/reference/geom_parallel_sets.html)

    library(ggforce) library(reshape2)   name_data &lt;- data.frame(     ""City"" = c(""Paris"", ""Paris"", ""Paris"", ""Paris"", ""Paris"", ""London"", ""London"", ""London"", ""Paris"", ""London"", ""Paris""),       ""First_Name"" = c(""John"", ""John"", ""John"", ""John"", ""John"", ""John"", ""James"", ""James"", ""Adam"", ""Adam"", ""Henry""),     ""Middle_Name"" = c(""Claude"", ""Claude"", ""Claude"", ""Smith"", ""Smith"", ""Peters"", ""Stevens"", ""Stevens"", ""Ford"", ""Tom"", ""Frank""),     ""Last Name "" = c(""Tony"", ""Tony"", ""Frank"", ""Carson"", ""Phil"", ""Lewis"", ""Eric"", ""David"", ""Roberts"", ""Scott"", ""Xavier"") )  name_data$ID &lt;- seq.int(nrow(name_data))   data &lt;- reshape2::melt(name_data) data &lt;- gather_set_data(name_data)  ggplot(name_data, aes(x, id = ID, split = First_Name, value = value)) +   geom_parallel_sets(aes( alpha = 0.3, axis.width = 0.1) +   geom_parallel_sets_axes(axis.width = 0.1) +   geom_parallel_sets_labels(colour = 'white') 

I think I am getting closer, but there are still some problems. Could someone please show me how to me a basic Sankey Diagram in R (preferably where it shows the number of people at each level, something like this : [https://i.redd.it/lrjdj45xrpo21.png](https://i.redd.it/lrjdj45xrpo21.png))?"
325,datascience,Might be interesting: Number of applicants for several data science job postings in Linkedin,"Link: https://imgur.com/a/FUidRQG

Note: **Bewerber = Number of applicants**, Mitarbeiter = Number of employees, Ansichten = Number of people who saw the ad, Woche = Week, Monat = Month

So I recently took the free linkedin premium version for 1 month on a fake account because I was curious to see how many people apply for data science positions. I just typed ""data scientist"" in the search field and since nobody nowadays really truly knows what a data scientist really is, I also included ""data analysts"" or ""data engineers"" type of positions. 

I was kind of shocked by the results, since most of these positions had a huge (by german standards) number of applicants, even if the posting was only several hours old. This might not sound a lot for americans where it is more acceptable to shotgun their cv's but keep in mind that:

- this is in Germany where a cover letter is a must. Germans tend to send few but personalised applications. 

- that there are that many applicants is kinda worrying since the amount of math required to understand the algorithms, while not that advanced, is advanced enough that it should filter out most people. Even if the math is not advanced, it should still filter out most people because most people in my experience don't like math and even try their best to avoid it, especially math concerning statistics.

- as a comparison: there are many more software engineering job postings and they rarely have more than 3 applicants, if at all.

- this is just Linkedin. Most of these jobs are also posted on other networks like indeed. So I think it is fair to say, that you can take those numbers and at least multiply it by 1,x

329,datascience,Doubt regarding Click Through Rate calculation (CTR),"Hey guys,

So I'm doing a use case for a company interview and one of the questions is to calculate the CTR for a sorting algorithm.

My question would be: Should I remove the operations where there were no products shown (even though some of them there were clicks on products)?Example (should discard this columns?):

|Number of impressions|Number of clicks|
|:-|:-|
|0|1|
|0|3|
|0|0|

CTR = #products clicked/#products shown

&amp;#x200B;

My other doubt is wether should I sum the clicks and the products shown and then divide one on other OR should I do the CTR for each operation:

Pseudo Python code (imagine that I have a dataframe):

    CTR = pd_df[""no_clicks""].sum() / pd_df[""no_impressions""].sum()

OR

    pd_df[""CTR""] = pd_df[""no_clicks""] / pd_df[""no_impressions""]
    CTR = pd_df[""CTR""].mean()

330,datascience,Which sectors in the future years will need most of data science?,"hi guys,

in a world day by day more interconnected and in which tech will domain, I'm trying to figure out what will be the sectors in the future that will need most of the data science knowledge.

I know that media, social networks, e-commerce are the main milestone, but I'm trying to imagine also other sectors. For example: in a world more tech-dependent i think cybersecurity will need to grow at the same rate in order to prevent attacks and similar stuff.

So, I'm trying to understand in which sector (excluding the main sector written above) will be valuable to spend time, to study, in order to be more ready for the next future.

In my opinion innovation in sector like e-commerce is ""finished"" (given that society (like amazon) cannot go too much over a more sophisticated recommendation system).

So, what do you think will be the sectors most interesting ""data science"" speaking? cybersecurity? blockchain? 

In which one will be better to spend time in order to have a job in it?

333,datascience,PSA for anyone who uses Notebooks and wants to transition to Pycharm/VSCode.,"I know a lot of people like to use notebooks because they let you execute code interactively in 'chunks', which is nice when you don't want your session aborted after waiting 3 hours for that model to run. However, the whole notebook setup isn't very conducive to actually building more complex things (like a library) with a structured directory.

In PyCharm, if you go to settings, there is an '[Execute Selection in Console](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-consoles.html#load-code)' keybinding which lets you highlight the code you want to run, and execute it. The same option exists in [VScode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38952053/how-to-run-the-select-code-in-vscode). This allows you to run your code interactively and be \_very\_ flexible in your development, as well as having access to a fully fledged IDE.

I thought I would post this here because a lot of the people I talked to who used notebooks didn't know this functionality exists in other IDEs, and were happy to switch knowing it does exist.

If you use R, you probably already know this exists in Rstudio ;)"
334,datascience,I don't know if I can keep it up with my masters program.," 

I've recently started pursuing a masters program in Data Science while working part time for my already Data Science job (been working as a DS for 2.5 years now) and I'm seriously struggling to find the motivation to stick with it.

I mostly started because of pressure from my parents (my dad calling me at least once a week and asking when I will finally get a masters degree) and because I thought it would open some doors for working internationally.

It's two months into the program now, and with working part-time and then Uni in the evenings, it's draining my life energy. I would much rather spend some time applying myself creatively, taking dance and art classes (as far as the pandemic allows), but I do not have the time during most of the week and then on my days off I'm either supposed to study or I'm just too exhausted to get off the couch.

Everyone says that it's only a two year program and I should just stick it out, but honestly it's making me lose interest in both my job AND the degree. It's just so much sitting in front of a PC being productive in the eyes of capitalism and there's like a million things I would rather do. But yeah I'm having second thoughts if not having a masters will make my future career more difficult or whatever.

Does anyone have some advice or wants to share their experience from a similar situation?"

I have a good academic average of 3.9 GPA and I have a considerable amount of experience with R (I absolutely love R), SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, and RapidMiner. I am currently looking for a 12-month position in the analytics field in Calgary so hopefully, I will have some work experience in the field before I apply. I want to get more advanced knowledge of this field after I finish my undergrad and I am looking for what is considered the top programs in Canada or the States (dependent on the tuition). The two programs that really piqued my interest were the MDSAI program at Waterloo and UBC MDS (especially the computational linguistics one). I wanted to get input on which programs will be likely to admit me as I don't have a pure STEM background and which ones would be the best to equip me to work with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies. 

Alternatively, I was thinking about delaying graduation a bit to take some advanced stats courses to better prepare me for the MDS program (Waterloo seems to have very strict requirements for entry).  The classes would relate to linear regression, stats in R, and statistical experimentation along with linear algebra and multivariable calculus. Is there potential to do an MS in Stats that would offer more lucrative opportunities if I choose to go this path?

Initially I started a time series analysis using Rob Hyndman's books, but the more I googled, I thought maybe it could turn into a regression problem with all the additional variables I was given, where we can pick what a day's volumes would be if we can predict a few other data points.  Finally, as I searched through this sub, some folks mention KNN (which I need to read up on!).

I'm at the point where I feel like there's so many ways to go about solving this - where do I even start?

My question:  How do you determine where to start?  Do you just throw the kitchen sink at it and see which method may be best to solve your solution.  What distinguishes a problem from being a regression vs a clustering problem vs a time series analysis vs a classification tree or any other way of going about solving a problem."
353,datascience,Bridge Between IT and End Users,"Hello,

My place of work has been expanding over the past several years. An unintended consequence of the expansion is a messy CRM. Our IT team has customized SalesForce significantly for our end users. There are several different teams of end users that have all requested features and new fields in the CRM at one time or another.

I currently work as a director of mail and telemarketing, but I've always had a dream of breaking into data. My team lead, the COO, has asked me if I want to build a new team that would be responsible for database cleanup, data hygiene, and potentially reporting down the line. 

My main responsibilities would be:

- Standardization and cleanup of the fields in our CRM

- Creation of business rules and SOPs

- Bridging the gap between the end user and IT

- Bringing multiple end users together and resolving any conflicts as it relates to the CRM

- Data hygiene, monitoring where data is coming in and cleaning it up for reporting

My questions are:

1. Is there a job title that closely relates to the responsibilities that are outlined above?

2. Does this position open future opportunities in the data world? I really want to become a data scientist.

Thank you for your help, I know this is a long post."

I had in mind that a dcGAN can be used for this. But not in a normal way. Normaly dcGAN's are used with CNN and it is used to create fake generated images of whatever thing you want to create and have data of. But instead of using the fake generated images I want to find the features it uses to most to create these fake images.

I understand that I don't have to use a CNN as the backbone of my dcGAN but i'm struggling to find what other models I can use and how I can extract these features which are found somewhere in the proces of generating the fakes.

362,datascience,Is the computer science minor worth it?,"I’m currently a sophomore statistics Major and double minoring in economics and statistics. I had chosen to choose minor in economics because it is one of my favorite subjects, but also has an intersection with statistics, with interesting topics such as econometrics. Now my goal isn’t to get into economics heavily, but thought it would be a good supplement. I chose to minor in computer science, thinking it would give me some sort of added value when applying for data science positions later on. However, throughout this semester and computer science coursework I’m not enjoying it as much, and feel as though the classes I will be taking aren’t going to be an added benefit if I become a data scientist. I know how to code, and code well enough where I can implement data science/cleaning tools and run statistical simulations in python with numpy/pandas etc. however the things I’m learning right now, (creating a compiler, low level programming) aren’t things I would need in the future, as opposed to the rigorous statistical + quantitative knowledge I’m taking from my math classes such as probability, calculus 3, Bayesian statistics, linear algebra etc. I’m thinking about dropping the minor solely based on the fact that at the end of the day, the courses I would have taken I feel like wouldn’t add as much benefit/credibility if I was applying for data scientist roles. The only real reason I’ve thought about keeping the cs minor is because I also have a interest in machine learning/deep learning, so if I ever want to go that route I’ll need a software background. Ik you all can’t explicitly say what I should do but what are your thoughts on this matter?"
363,datascience,How do you develop an array programming mindset?,"# What I want and why

I want:

* An intuitive way to think in matrices and vectors
* To manipulate regression arguments vectors through loops of layered operations
* To generate beautiful custom data tables for stakeholders presentation without resorting to others’ table programs
* Support within Stata's ""platform"" (others should be able to work on it) 
* Extensibility with object-oriented programming, but not OOP being the exclusive way to think about arrays and programs
* To build and share packages 

# What I already have

I am:

* Paid to wrangle and analyze data in Stata, R and Python (in decreasing order)
* Well-versed in control flows
* All too locked into the imperative language mindset
* Frustrated with Stata’s array language, Mata
* Confused with various implementations of arrays across languages

# Where do I go and how do I get there?

Looking at my words up here, it sounds like Python and `numpy` might fit the bill. Do you agree? If not, what do you recommend instead? If so, what should I look into to go beyond imperative programming?

364,datascience,What methods for detecting misleading statistical aggregates?,"***(Disclaimer:*** *vague question, I welcome among other things help in formulating it more precisely.)*

**Example:** [this chart](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/primary-energy-consumption-by-source?time=1965..latest) shows the evolution of global energy consumption by source, with a significant bump in coal consumption since 2000. One thing that's both instructive and not visible in this chart is that ***this bump in coal mostly happened in just one country: China***.

Likewise, by standard metrics, global economic inequality has decreased in the past decades; but if you exclude China the picture is quite different: ***for the rest of the world, inequality has in fact increased*** ^((1)).

**My problem:** Now, when doing exploratory data analysis and plotting such charts, I wish I had **tools that (automatically) point out such inhomogeneities in the data**, especially when the aggregation collapses so many dimensions that it would be impractical to explore all of them manually.

For instance, in the above example of energy production, I could imagine an algorithm that would do some clustering to partition the data into a few country groups (such that within each group the data has in some sense less divergence from the aggregate), and display me one chart per country group.

***My question:*** ***how do people approach this problem?*** *Could you point me to tools / resources / search keywords to dig deeper?*

366,datascience,Looking for a suitable software for data visualization,"Dear all, 

I conducted an analysis of qualitative data, which captures the change process of an organization. I have different classes of events and those events are interdependent. That means without event A, event B would not take place. Since there are a lot of events, I would like to find a way to visualize these events and interdependencies, similarly to a dependency diagram. 

However, I would at the same time like to store data for each of the events (interview excerpts that provide first hand information about the event). It would be amazing to create such a dependency diagram and if I click on an event, the program provides me the additional information that I stored about the event. 

So, what I am basically looking for is a tool that is somehow a mix between a Gantt chart maker and a tool that makes dependency graphs. Do you know something that could help me?"
367,datascience,I got the chance to interview a Machine Learning Consultant :),"Hey guys -

[Vin Vashishta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vineetvashishta/) is an Applied Machine Learning Consultant who’s an industry veteran. I thought it would be cool to talk to him about his day to day, how being a consultant (and running his own company) is different to working as an employee, and what advice he has to those looking to break into the field.

\-----------------

**You have a background in engineering. Can you tell me a bit about your early days? Were you always interested in Data Science?**

The first piece of my education was in Computer Science. Microsoft gave my university a grant to do Machine Vision research and that’s what I worked on whilst I was in college. I expected to graduate, go straight into Microsoft and work on AI, but the wave of AI at the time, in the 90s, petered out and so that wasn’t possible.

And what’s interesting is that models back then were different to now. The definition of model was more a scientific definition - you looked at examples in environmental sciences, climatology, etc. Those were models that had solid features which were proven - you could do mathematical proofs that showed that these models did what they were supposed to do.

We didn’t get that at the beginning of machine learning a lot and a lot of students don’t get that concept. That you don’t just train and test, but then you go out and validate. You have to prove your model works, you can’t just rely on predefined metrics.

So anyways, I spent 15 years in technology. I did everything from installing PCs and building websites to leading teams. I’ve been involved at every stage of the software development cycle.

**How did the transition to Data Science look like?**

In 2010, I was working at a casino gaming company. One of the projects I got to work on started gathering data across different casinos and we were able to follow players from casino to casino. This is similar to marketing where you’re able to follow the same user from one site to the other. The team I was working with had experience in the video game sector, where this type of attribution is common, so we were all able to connect the dots.

And then I got laid off. So I had this chaotic 6 week period where I was looking for a job but then I just decided to start a business. I realized that I could do much of the analysis I had been doing at my job for other clients.

Starting a business though meant that I had to learn so many new things. There was no blueprint, I had to learn through experience. The machine learning research had been there for 8-10 years but the hard part was applying it within the context of industry.

Then, on the business side, I had to learn other things like sales and marketing. I hate selling but enjoy marketing.

**What does working with clients look like?**

I say no to clients more than they say no to me. I want to make sure clients are set up for success right from the beginning and a lot of the time that’s hard to do. Sometimes, they *think* they want to do machine learning but they really don’t - they want to do something else.

And sometimes I just have to tell them that what they’re doing is not machine learning. It’s just advanced analytics. In those cases, I have to teach the team how to do it. I have to help them build the models.

There’s a bit more scientific rigor needed to create something that works. There’s a level of maintenance and monitoring post deployment that needs to be done which is often overlooked and I need to often educate clients on this part.

In a lot of cases, I enjoy my work because I have to go into a company and teach senior leadership what monetizing machine learning products means, build a path to production, and bring teams together. For instance, dev teams often have to get involved - there’s quality and assurance to be done at the feature level, there’s data wrangling and transformation to worry about, there’s the data pipelines that need to be considered, etc. So there’s a lot of moving parts that need to be outlined at the strategy level.

**What company sizes are you normally working with?**

I’ve worked with startups all the way up to Fortune 100 clients. And it may sound like they’re completely different processes, but a big company is willing to do something very similar to what a startup does but it just has more teams. So in bigger companies, it is basically just a rapid deployment of this process and adoption cross teams.

The startup has few teams. So the depth of adoption is fairly simple - I can sit down with everyone who’s going to be involved within the process and just have one on ones.

In a larger company, I am initially working with one set of teams for a particular product line. And we are creating a very detailed and consistent process. Once you’ve done it once, then those teams can go out and teach other teams how to do it. Now you’re able to create this institutional knowledge on how to do machine learning from your research phase all the way down to maintenance and continuous improvement.

Another important thing to mention based on this: it may only take the startup about 6 months to be fully educated on this process since there’s less people than at a larger company, where it may take 2 years. But once a larger company has multiple teams educated on the process, they can then themselves do the education to other teams, so the rate of iteration grows and the actual ROI is similar in terms of timeline to what the startup sees.

**What does an average day look like?**

I usually wake up around 5am and start doing social media. That’s a big part of what I do marketing wise. So I’m writing blogs, doing interviews like this, and responding to emails.

I then will have some standing meetings with clients. I’ll also spend 2-3 hours a day building a model or reviewing it. I’ll spend a few hours a day on strategy calls sitting in on senior leadership and helping them understand product performance.

Every two weeks, I do an executive seminar where I explain concepts like monetization or product planning. I answer lots of questions and understand what my customers’ needs are.

So I wear a lot of hats everyday but do enjoy most of it.

**How important is storytelling within Data Science? What are some ways we can get better at it?**

Well, you need communication skills and that starts with having communication objectives. And then understanding how to use language to achieve those objectives.

The main case of that involves data. The more complex the concept behind the communication objective, the worse words do. Words break down very quickly as a mechanism to exchange complex ideas. So you have to use visuals instead.

In many cases, you have to put a whole lot of information into a very simple format. And again the visualizations carry with them the communication objectives. And a lot of the time, you’re not there to do the translation (because your visualization may go out in a dashboard). So you have to build visualizations that stand on their own and are not able to be over extended. They need to have that asterix in important places.

The hard part about this is that the story always evolves. The dataset isn’’t static. So your story is evolving and you have to explain to users that even though there is more data to consume, it still has an end. There is still some assessment that is unsupported even though it may feel like it is.

370,datascience,AI to fix the education crisis,"***Join the $100,000 Kaggle competition to improve education by creating new algorithms that can teach students using AI.***

Parents and teachers have known for centuries that the best education is delivered one-on-one by an experienced educator. But that is expensive, labor intensive and cannot scale.

Algorithms can uncover patterns about how students perform and algorithms can help teachers optimize their strategies accordingly. “AI tutors,” software systems that students interact with online, can give every student greater access to the individualized attention they need.

But research in the field has been slow, as students and their professors focus on other aspects of artificial intelligence. The inaugural Riiid AIEd Challenge, announced this month, hopes to change that by inviting leading global AI talent to compete on Google’s Kaggle competition platform to create deep learning algorithms for education.

The goal is to create algorithms that can track the knowledge states of more than a million students in the wild. Already, the challenge has been joined by nearly 1,200 competitors, more than 10 percent of which are Kaggle Grandmasters.

Knowledge tracing can model student comprehension as they interact with coursework and is used to predict how the student will perform on future interactions so that a study plan can be adapted to the student’s individual needs.

The winning teams in the annual competition will share $100,000 in prize money and the winning model will be presented at a workshop at the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence conference in February next year.

The competition is based on the world’s largest dataset of student-AI interactions, called EdNet, created by a Korean-based AI education company, Riiid. To leverage the power of that dataset and advance AI for education, the company has joined with universities and other educational organizations including the non-profit DXtera Institute, to launch the AIEd Challenge.

Such challenges have been used in the past to focus the world’s best academic minds on difficult problems, and are responsible for some of the most significant advances in artificial intelligence. The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge led to breakthroughs in computer vision, for example, and the US DARPA Grand Challenge kicked off the development of self-driving cars.

“As an adviser to this important event, I look forward to reviewing AI-backed solutions that can give educators insightful directions to best coach young minds,” said Paul Kim, Associate Dean and Chief Technology Officer at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Education.

AI and the Internet hold the promise of democratizing quality education. By focusing the best AI minds in the world on the improvement of AI-enabled education, researchers and teachers together can design a new paradigm for education in the post-COVID era.

*Craig S. Smith is a former New York Times correspondent and host of the podcast,* [*Eye on AI*](https://www.eye-on.ai)*. Anyone interested in participating in the Riiid AIEd Challenge should visit* [*https://www.ednetchallenge.ai*](https://www.ednetchallenge.ai) *for more details.*"

379,datascience,Can someone please comment on my model results?,"I trained a ml model for binary classification. On the 30% test set(~ 1500 observations) i got the following results: (the binary class in the test set is distributed ~ 3:1)

Accuracy: 79%
Kappa: 0.31

Sensitivity: 80%
Specificity:67%

Pos pred value (ppv): 95%
Neg pred value (npv): 31%

I think these results are good. I think the  sens/spec is more important than ppv and the npv values; given that the sens/spec is decent.

The way i see it:
Suppose there is a math exam with 100 questions. I only answer 20 questions. Of the 20 I answered, I got  18 correct.

My ppv could be seen as 90%
But my overall grade on the exam was only 18%

Hey. I'm sorting through historical 13F data. I need to assess if a stock has been sold.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I have two conditions. 1- If there's a gap higher than 500 days between two consecutive filing  dates. This is retarded, I know, filing date is a flimsy metric to rely on. Another condition I have is shares dropping to 0. Still, the maximum sell times I'm getting is 3. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the data I have that I got from scraping the SEC site for each CIK I had: 1- Filing Date 2- CUSIP 3- Symbol 4- Share (sshprnamt) 5- Value. Plus some other metrics that are useless such as title of class and some voting authorities.

I'm a Computer Science student at a local CC in Southern California and I've been exploring careers. I still have like 2-3 more years til I graduate and I was looking into Data Analytics. I would like to ask you guys a few questions to get some more insight.

1. Education/Degree?
2. Position (I know it's most likely Data Analyst, but I'm just going to assume it kind of varies from company to company somehow)?
3. Salary?
4. Area?
5. Previous positions/Experience?
6. How is it?
7. Any recommendations on courses/paths/projects I should take so I can get an internship and/or a job?"
394,datascience,Are continuing education (post-grad) data science programs seen as a good start to the data science world?,"To sum up my background - I have a master’s in experimental (research) psychology, and have been working in research full time for over 5 years. A big part of my role includes data management, parsing, statistical theory and analysis, and I’m great with R.

I’m looking into a short 4-course data science certificate program that “covers the 7 domains of INFORMS Certified Analytics Professional (CAP) certification”. Would I be *lucky* to even get an entry level data science position, or could I convince employers that my background in data would make me valuable in something slightly higher?"
395,datascience,How do you deal with long-running lines of code?,"As someone who dabbles in data science, I've had this problem multiple times. You have \~10GB of data that you need to feature engineer before feeding that data into some ML algorithm. It's 10GB so it doesn't feel like it's worth it to start up a Databricks notebook or build something custom. So instead, you run it on your laptop and go do something else for a while. Sometimes, that line of code takes a minute. Sometimes it takes 5 hours. Either way, it breaks your workflow.

I read through the CRISP-DM literature, which seems like a start, but I don’t hear people in practice saying they use CRISP.  

I’ve seen some teams practicing daily stand-ups as a tactic, sure, but not using a proactive workflow management approach. I’ve seen teams using Jira, which is great, but again, that’s a tool, not an approach."
402,datascience,"What are good ""milestones"" when developing a model? Accuracy? Simply acquiring the data?","Hi r/datascience,

Here's maybe a fun one: I am applying for a grant for which I believe my project, developing a better insulin pump algorithm for diabetes control, is perfect for. 

Now, I'm working with a few people who are more expert in this field than I, but I'm taking the first pass at describing the milestones. Since the algorithm will need to learn from data that has historically seldom been a focus reported in literature , the grant is simply allowing us to collect that data in biomedical experiments. I describe the milestones in terms of hours worth of recordings and data about numerous other biomedical endpoints, providing us a bunch of new context you don't really see in the literature, but my consultant asked if it made sense to talk about anything ""more"" than that. 

It doesn't make sense to promise model accuracy or a certain amount of false positives as a milestone, does it? The point isn't to make something ready to deploy to the market, but to investigate the proof of concept/ model validity...and just getting the data is 90% of the work. Considering it's not representative data of ""the real world,"" it may be really helpful as an early start. It seems kind pointless to describe milestones in terms of promising performance ""accuracy"" when it's certain new contexts outside the lab will destroy that. 

But surely I don't want to say the model will be less than 50% accurate...but could I not simply overfit my model to be what I want it to be?

FWIW I'm probably not the final say on this type of info anyway, but I wanted to ask here first. I appreciate any discussion on the matter!"

414,datascience,There is too much skepticism and disillusionment in data science and machine learning in the community,"In the past months/years I have noticed that the mood in the data science community is changing. It seems as if every project is doomed to failure. One could also get the impression that almost no ML engineer or data scientist is working with real machine learning. I want to point out that it is not as bad as it seems in this subreddit.

I have been working in this field since before the hype started, and it is true that there have been exaggerations. Especially in the media, an incredible number of things were promised that could not be kept. Suddenly, machine learning was to be used anywhere where a little thinking was the solution.

However, very exciting AI systems have been built, which also provide great value. There are successful start-ups that have achieved really big things with ML. Yes, and there are the Data Scientists/ML Engineers, who have created value in the company with neural networks and also really do a lot of machine leaning, aside form simple regression/XGB.

It is not like at university, where new algorithms are invented and research is done. Much of it is craftsmanship and plumbing, but still machine learning is often the core of such systems. I personally was involved with several ML system, a lot of them still in production and generating value.

I think another reason for the shift is that there was an inflation of data science job titles from people entering the field with 6 months bootcamps. I don't want to gate keep, but you can not expect to play on the same level as people with several years exp (phds, masters, self-taught whatever). Don't take job titles to serious.

I also don't want to make false promises, there is more supply than demand for AI jobs. A lot of people entered the field for the money, however if you are passionate about AI and ML and did your studies (not a 3 months bootcamp, sorry) people will notice. There might be a lot of supply, but not a lot of good supply.

One last advice: Don't be too much focused on FANG. I have some friends at FANG and a lot of them are unhappy with their work, optimizing KPIs, very few exiting ml stuff, but the money has them. They can't go anywhere else with a massive financial drawback. Focus an smaller companies with good ideas and tech related mindset. Be careful about hype-driven AI-startups and large non-tech dinosaurs."

I just did a screening interview with a manager at a small data science consulting firm and he said they typically bring people on as full-time temps with no benefits for a couple months before hiring as full-time employees if they perform well and fit well with the culture. His phrase was ""Slow to hire, but quick to fire"", which instantly sounded like a red flag to me. Other than that, he seemed pretty cool, the teams sound hip and fun, and the work they do is pretty interesting. I'm relatively new and trying to break in to data science. Did a lot of statistical/math modeling before and more recently some machine learning projects on my own time but that's it. I definitely would need guidance/development time in my next role wherever that may be and wouldn't want to be somewhere they're just gonna toss me into the fire with no help.

People who've been the field, is this common or something to avoid? I have another offer that's more stable but the work is less interesting and not my ideal location. Any advice/input would be appreciated. Thanks."
417,datascience,Can we put an end to Gallup already?,"1- They use datascience to engineer results, not to get results.

2- They use archaic methods most of the times, not modern data science. Their charts are generated by 80s ISS software.

4- They still use phone calls! I live in Iran, they, at least they introduced themselves as Gallup, called me to ask if I'm a Muslim and I agree with the government. My answer to either is no, but I hung up. Who will tell the truth here?

These are just some of theirs sins. As a data scientist, I hate them. Especially when there's an election. Trolls LOVE to use Gallup results. Please put an end to this organization."

450,datascience,How much data to utilize for inferential statistics?,"Hey there,

I've been thinking about a problem I have when doing inferential statistics on data that is severely imbalanced. For example, in health that could be a dataset of individuals and whether they have a very rare disease. Another one in business is a free trial for a product where only a small percentage end up paying. 

When building something to optimize predictive power, you use undersampling/oversampling of this dataset and apply maybe a logistic regression to achieve a ""good"" prediction. 

However, what if what I care about is the actual coefficients of the model itself so that I can create recommendations or forecast different situations? If I undersample/oversample, it's ""skewing"" what the real world dataset looks like so my coefficients won't be the ""real"" ones that apply to the entire dataset. That makes sense to me but the issue I find is just how crappy the model would become without utilizing sampling so is there strategies here to still do inference or some rationale I might not be thinking about correctly?

456,datascience,General questions on statistical modelling,"Ive been scouring the internet to find some clear answers on these topics but I couldn't find anything definite. Could someone please help me out?

1) i have data with categorical and continuous features. The categorical features have many categories. When I one hot encode everything, I have around 260 features in total. I ran an xgboost model on this data and got surprisingly decent (high specificity and sensitivity) results (k fold cross validation, as well as the test set) 

Should I be concerned? 260 features, half of which are one hot encode (1 or 0), sounds kind of sketchy? (I started with 25 variables)

2) often, due to the one hot encoding: i run into a situation where a new observation has a category not accounted for in the data used to build the model. What is the best way to deal with this problem? I found a work around for the random forest algorithm, but not for xgboost.

3) what is the ""best way"" to present your final model to your boss?

I have a bit of a dilemma: I have data from the past 5 years, I am interested in classifying observations (binary response) for the next year (this data obviously doesn't exist yet). I have two choices for evaluating the model:

Choice 1: I select a 30% test set from the whole data,  train a model/k fold cross validation using the other 70%. Then I can report on the performance.

Choice 2: I select data from the first 4 years and build a model, and then test the performance of this model on the 5th year. 

(At the end, no matter which choice i make, the final model to predict future data will be made using all data available from the 5 years)

Is one of these choices better than the other? Is one of these choices more reliable and less biased than the other?

Thanks!"
457,datascience,Something to Consider: Open Offices,"This seems like a fairly irrelevant thing to discuss given that it may be quite a while before many of us are crammed back into offices.

But if you are considering multiple job offers, it's worth asking if they have open office layouts.   They're quite popular with some companies (mostly because it's cheap and easy to cram in extra people I suspect).  They claim it enhances ""collaboration"" but that's effectively a lie in my experience.

But I am here to tell you, I hate it.  I work in an office where there are 3 workstations side-by-side along a long table/desk with maybe 3 feet between them (occupied by you own personal cubby reminiscent of elementary school) and facing a second such desk so your monitors are literally 2 inches from the person sitting at the desk across from you.  And five feet behind you is the back of the person at the next row of desk.

I cannot exaggerate how much this sucks.   If any one of the 9 people immediately surrounding you is on the phone or talking to someone, you know about it.  God help you if someone has an annoying habit of humming or something. I don't actually know anyone at work who prefers the open office to what we used to have (cubes) and we pretty much all agree it has hurt productivity.  I'm probably going to retire in the next six months (apocalypse dependent) and I am quite hopeful to not have to go back to it.

Other people may have different experiences (please share), but all that to say, given the choice between 2 similar jobs, one of which was an open office, I would take the other one."

459,datascience,Who said notebooks are not for production? 📒,"A recurrent discussion in Data Science regards the use of notebooks in production. When engineers have to productionize work by data scientists, they often ask them to re-write their notebook-based pipelines as ""production code"", which is usually a way of saying ""use functions"". In the most severe cases, the production team might just re-write the whole thing.

The reality is that a lot (if not most) data scientists love notebooks (myself included) because they make us more productive. It is a simply much natural way to find interesting things in the data.

Wouldn't be great if we could develop function-based pipelines interactively that are production-ready? **Ploomber 0.8.1 adds a new feature that enables interactive development of Python functions using Jupyter.**

Just start Ploomber's interactive mode, then call `dag['task_name'].develop()` and a Jupyter instance will spin up, rendering your function as a notebook. When you're done editing, just press save and results will be written back to the original function.

A model that predicts if a user rejects or not certain task, and there is a feature that is the % of rejection (over time), when training if user x has rejected that said task, the % feature increases in that instance. Is the model able of detecting if that feature increase compared to the previous entrace of user x automatically means that the feature it's trying to predict has a target of rejected? Or the model only looks to one particular instance at a given time and this doesn't matter when training? 

Question is am I facing feature leakege if I don't shift these features in a n-1 factor?

If I am using a random forest than each instance is a set of trees so it can't look to the ""past"" to infer this information in the set, however if hypothetically a linear regression was used (this isn't the case since we are looking at a supervised classficiation model) the slope would change then the ""past"" and the ""future"" aka previous and next user x instance would let the model infer  such data.

I am working on my dissertation research where I am attempting to build a generalizable machine-learned method of predicting student a student's likelihood of dropping out of high school (at-risk status). I won't bore you with the details, but part of my dissertation research involves replicating existing validated EWS's (early warning systems) on my data (n = 3M) and then comparing the performance to see if there is a significant improvement in identifying student risk status at scale. [One of the models I am attempting to replicate is built using a Growth Mixture model approach in Mplus](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/26586928.pdf?casa_token=FoId70KWz0QAAAAA:tp05La9s5BUyeM7R3bN0mBfIRjfFCed-p6LcmXRdfvMTQKbtm6IDdq8TMxVrFOW-zv_PPJ3-65MpPBI5vqtcJD0WodgvaWrKqEoNh2BegdE3k5N92i8), the author also sits on my committee. As part of our discussions, one of the requests I received from the author was to see if I can productionize his Mplus model using R or Python. 

**Questions**

* Is there a way to replicate this approach using R or Python? From what I understand, this specific GMM approach only exists in Mplus.

* If it's possible to use something other than Mplus (and this more of a dissertation advice question), do you think it is a good idea to use a different software approach? I'm not very confident in my knowledge around GMM's, and I'm afraid the libraries in Python or R are implemented differently, not mention the lack of available resources on how to conduct this type of analysis. 

* Does anyone know if it is possible to wrap code (API, etc.) around an Mplus GMM to generate new predictions for non-labeled data?"

495,datascience,Forecasting monthly sales to customers that aren't customers yet?,"Hello everybody,

I am currently stuck with a problematic model and I am very lost. I have tried many different things but still no success. I have to forecast monthly sales for customers I don't yet have.

Let me elaborate further:

Say for example, I have a list of 100,000 persons, where I have client name, area, postal code and other points, but none of these data points are sales related. Lets say these are data points from table A. This list is my possible universe of customers.

Out of these 100,000 persons, \~10,000 are already my customers and I have sales data for them. These sales data is table B.

Now, the goal here is to forecast what my monthly sales per client would be in a scenario where the 100,000 persons from table A are already my clients.

I tried building different regression models that take as input a joint table between table A and table B, resulting in the 10,000 rows from table B plus the added columns from table A. I would then go on to apply the model to the other 90,000 persons and predict a monthly sales value.

The problem is it seems the variables are not related. My correlation matrix shows a max absolute correlation between two variables of \~.25, and my mean errors are really lacking. I tried using linear regression, random forests, ridge regression, k-neighbors regressor, and still no cookie.

What I'm trying to do now is to use the 10,000 points for which I do have sales data to create clusters, and then extrapolate the cluster value to the other 90,000 and sort of generate a sales value based on cluster and other qualitative values...

Any help is appreciated,

498,datascience,Data science position using SAS,"Hi,

I have worked for 15 months at a big4 consulting company doing analytics since graduating with a masters in quantitative finance. I want to pivot my career towards more advanced analytics, and I am afraid my current company will not be able to provide me this work. I have been offered a data science position at a relatively unknown company that does credit scoring and risk analysis as a service for banks. They use SAS for everything don’t do much more than logistic regression. I know that it’s not too common to do that much advanced machine learning in real life, so I get that - but I’m kind of bummed over their extensive use of SAS. I use Python almost daily at my current jobb for data transformations, visualisation and some analytics, and I definitely believe open source is the way of the future. I don’t want to leave this new data science job after a few years and only know how to do data science in SAS.


Is this a deal-breaker, or am I being too idealistic here? I work for a great company today with good possibilities for career advancement, but they do very little «advanced» stuff, and mostly IT strategy, implementation, warehousing and BI. 

Would love to hear any input on this.

i think im getting confused as to what exactly a person working in BA or BI does, as it all sounds very vague when someone tells me they ""optimize"". also i've started to wonder if im studying the wrong field, as im generally speaking more into programming as to economics. i mean why do I need this much knowledge in financing and organizations? the business part of the program really does not interest me much, but i would be more open to it if i knew why i need to learn about it."

A) Are some of these transformation ""inherently"" better than others?

B) I am very interested in using the random forest algorithm (as well as xgboost).

503,datascience,General approach for fitting a pde to data,"I have some data and I want to find a function that serves as a good model for it. I probably use chi2 to determine how good the model is. For my case it would be enough to find a pde such that at least one solution is a good model.
  
Since I can't make many assumptions about the true model of the data my naive approach is to consider a general pde f(x, u, u^1 ,..., u^s ) = 0, such that f is a polynomial of fixed order n. I then numerically calculate the first s derivatives of the data and try to fit f to 0 with the least square method. If the fit is good enough I'd use f, if not I'd increase n and repeat.
  
Since I'm not used to these kinds of problems I want to ask if there are better approaches to this. I also was thinking if it would be better to actually fit f to the Fourier transformed data because calculating the derivatives becomes trivial then, or to expand f as Fourier series instead of Taylor series because the Taylor expansion converges around one point while the Fourier expansion converges ""everywhere simultaneously"" in L^2"

505,datascience,Time series vs longitudinal analysis vs survival analysis,"I am having a bit of trouble understanding the ideal situation for using time series modelling. Especially if the predictor variables are time dependent.

Suppose : 

1) You are modelling a binary response ""meet expectation or not meet expectation"". For a given company, you have predictor variables indicating how much they earn each year, spend each year, etc. There are 25 years of data, i.e. 25 rows for each company (for all previous years, you know if they met expectations or not). You are interested in making a prediction for the available companies for the current year. 

Is this a time series problem or a longitudinal study problem?

2) What if now in addition to the data in 1), you also have ""static"" information about each of these companies such as the country they are from and the industry they belong to. For each of the 25 years, this information is the same, but the financial information is changing. We are still interested in prediction for available companies current year.

Is this a time series problem?

3) Suppose instead of ""meeting expectations"", the response variable is now ""permanent bankruptcy"" (still binary). We have historical information on companies for 25 years, unless they went bankrupt earlier (then the information is only available for the last year they were in business). We now want to predict when these existing companies will go bankrupt.

Is this a time series problem?

4) similar to 3), but now we want to make predictions about bankruptcy for new companies who have been around for 5 years.

Is this a time series problem?

I can't seem to decide if this time series, longitudinal analysis or survival analysis. 

Should I use survival classification models? Or just a LSTM network for these types of problems?"

My first instinct is to grab what I think are relevant features and run them through trees. But I'm also going through the data scientist pathway on super data science, and just learned about multiple linear regression to determine which features are statistically relevant. Is that something that's seen as just good practice? Or do you veterans ""just"" know your data that well, that you can make that determination on your own.

507,datascience,Work experience before a master's or just start immediately after Bachelor's degree,"As the title says, which one do you think is better?
On one hand, getting experience can be something attractive when applying for a master's degree, and can help you tons when studying ,and be a huge difference when applying for jobs after getting your master's degree or during your degree.

On the other hand, do you really need a master's assuming you got some experience from good companies? Or would that be a wasted 1-2 yrs?

With that said, there is a scholarship options by the Swedish Government that would 100% fund your Swedish Master's degree plus your stay in Sweden, but it does require 2 years of experience under your belt, would that be an interesting opportunity or would you just straight out continue working with your Bachelor's if things are going well?

The reason why I find this opportunity quite interesting is ,because it would allow me to potentially get a good paying job in Europe after my Master's given it would be hard to travel aboard without a master's degree -because of all the visas and stuff related to that given that I come from Egypt- but that would cost me 2 years of my life but yea I'd love to hear your thoughts.

508,datascience,Data science skills for social entrepreneurship?,"Hey all,

I’m at a crossroads in my masters program (MS, Social Entrepreneurship) where I can take 1-2 data science classes as electives before I graduate at the end of this summer OR I can add on a certificate in business analytics and delay my graduation date by a year (and end up taking an extra 3-4 data science courses). 

Option 1 with graduation date after Summer 2021:
Would take a SQL class and one more data science class that’s an overview of the different tools. 

Pro: Graduate earlier with a Masters in Social Entrepreneurship, and could get a raise at my current job or start applying to other jobs in social impact. 

Con: Very introductory knowledge of data science and would need to self-teach (which I have to date not been successful at. The structure and accountability of live professors really helps me). Do not receive business analytics certificate. 


Option 2 with graduation date after Spring 2022:
Would take SQL class, class that focuses on data warehousing and SAS JMP, class that focuses on R, class that focuses on applied managerial statistics.

Pro: get business analytics certificate added to my masters degree. 

Con: more time stuck at my current job because I am using the tuition benefit to pay for school. Though to be honest, I do not mind my current job. I just don’t see much room for upward mobility so the longer I stay, the more time I feel I am wasting not working in the social impact field where I actually want to be.

Questions:
1. What data science skills, tools, languages are most relevant for someone interested in the nonprofit and social impact field? I would love to be able to analyze, communicate, and make decisions using data for existing nonprofits or for new start-ups. I want some useful hard skills for my resume. 
2. Are these skills that I could easily teach myself or should I go through the university program to learn them?
3. Is having a business analytics certificate even helpful during the job search? Do employers care?

Thank you in advance for your guidance."
509,datascience,"Is a DS masters worth it, while already working as a data scientist?","(I've searched through similar threads on this but they don't get to the crux of what I'm after -- apologies if this seems redundant)

Background: I'm 25 and have a background in CS + econ undergrad. I've been working as a ""junior data scientist"" for 2+ years at a great startup, which has given me really good exposure to DS topics. I've been able to learn a ton in terms of methods and approaches.

I am getting great experience and have been learning a ton for two years. I do not expect this to change. However, I am hyper aware that there are things I lack in terms of knowledge. If/when I may need to seek a more senior role, I worry these things may hold me back, and it will be obvious because I don't have a degree directly in the field. Perhaps this is underconfidence, but my experience is only in the things that I've needed to apply in whatever projects/problems come along at work. As a result, I'm considering several strong **part time** DS masters programs nearby (in NYC). My main motivation would be for knowledge (shore up stats + understand DS technique landscape) and the credential (to prove on future job searches that I have the knowledge/ability).

I am fully willing and able to put in the work needed to do such a program part time, if it is better for my future. Cost is NOT a factor. So, I thought it was a given that I should do the masters; however, a conversation I had with someone senior at work is making me reconsider.

I am trying to reconcile:

1. Conventional wisdom - pretty typical, education is always good, of course it's worth going to grad school and getting a resume item and gaining knowledge
2. Senior guy at work - basically, he went into his own history about how he got a PhD, doesn't think it was worth it, and would have been better off working full time and getting real world experience. These graduate programs tend to be cash grabs, so I would be far better off simply learning as much as possible *through the data science role I already have*, which employers will value way more. Even if I feel like my knowledge is lacking, I should just learn the basics of whatever topics on my own, and seek to apply them through work projects; this is the best way to learn and employers will prefer proven ability to learn/apply. In the end, most of what you do in your career is figuring out messy problems and learning on the fly, which school won't help with more vs. what I am already gaining through my current job. Additionally (and this struck me as... weird), he thinks some future employers might view the masters program as a red flag; it would imply I needed to go back to school to be successful in the field, making them discount the 2 yrs of experience I already have.

I'm sure there's truth to both perspectives. After hearing the latter, I'm strongly reconsidering getting a masters. I have already spent a lot of time on my own learning about DS topics, so there's no reason I can't continue to do so as the person from work mentioned. Maybe it would save me the trouble/time of school, assuming I were truly dedicated to that pursuit. Why kill myself for 2+ years if it's not necessary?

Can anyone here offer their point of view -- those involved in hiring, or those who have done a masters while already having a DS role? I understand the calculus is often more complicated due to cost, but that is not a factor here; this is solely a choice of what's best for my future. Am I a fool for not jumping at the opportunity to get a free masters, which will surely only benefit me? Or is it a masters a bad choice because I already have a good job -- not worth stressing over for the next 2+ years to get a degree that employers won't value, I can learn the topics of better independently/through work, and could even be seen as detrimental."

The situation is that I'm trying to scrape the information off of a web based (customer) CMS that has sales information on it to have it then get those values into excel or Google sheets to ultimately build a report, thus saving time/errors from flipping through all of them manually.

I remember using a solution (multiple tools) once that would basically go through the pages and take values from defined fields on those pages and then throw that information into columns on a sheet that we'd then manipulate manually. I'm pretty sure it was python based and (I think) used tampermonkey extension to get the information on a dev/debugger version of chrome.

The process looked something like this:

* Already logged into the CMS -&gt; Execute the tool/script that would then automatically open an order in a new window
* It'd then go through that order and take values from specific fields and then copy those values in a sheet
* It'd then close the window and proceed on to the next order in the specified range
* Once it completes the specified (date) range, the columns would be something like salesperson / order number / sale amount / attachment amount / etc - to then be manually manipulated, no further automation needed (beyond the formulas in the sheet)

Building your network on LinkedIn is critical for finding that first job and my goal is to help you do that.

I want the content to be a mix of the following:

1. Q&amp;A Sessions
2. Useful blog posts for getting a job
3. Open-ended comment threads to allow you to engage with other members

This is a start but if we grow this enough, it'd be really cool to create DS/ML competitions and make it easy for you all to collaborate with other data scientists

If you're interested, check it out [here](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13913186/). If not, I'd love to hear why on this thread.

535,datascience,Win an Amazon Gift Card by contributing to an open-source dataset!,"Hello! I am a part of LiveSensus, a team of 5 Computer Science and Computer Engineering students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. We’re working on a project that measures a listener's tolerance to different audio issues that may come up during live streams, video calls, or online lectures.

We’ve created a survey where users can rate audio clips based on their perception of audio quality. The survey takes no longer than 5 minutes to complete. After taking this survey, there is also a chance to enter to win an Amazon gift card!

We've been really excited to get this project up and running in a Covid-19 world where many workers, students, etc., have transitioned to online alternatives. Please feel free to contact us with any questions and most of all any comments for improvement. Any insights would go a really long way!

536,datascience,Need Help in Choosing the Right School for Masters (EU),"Hello folks, 

I've devoured this subreddit looking for (relatively) recent information on this topic and given the pandemic I thought I would proceed with a new post. 

Here's my background -   
Bachelor's - Electronics and Communication Engineering  
Remote PG Diploma (graduating March '21) - Data Science (includes a lot of ML, and a specialization in Deep Learning, Neural Networks  
Work - 2 years at a Big 4 consulting firm, with analytics experience on Tableau. 

I am certain I have an interest in ML and DL and want to proceed with my Master's. I know the US ivy league schools would be the best place to go, but with the H1-B visas become scarce and many of my friends ending up jobless in the US, I am not so certain about it. I am now looking at options in the EU. 

From any of your experience, do you recommend EU as a good place to choose over US/Canada for a Masters degree in this field (as of now)? And, do you think I am too late for applications for the Sep '21 intake? I have looked at some schools and most of them have an application deadline of March '21. 

And, how do I really look at if a course is good? Are there any alumni networks, or specific websites where I can connect with people and get to know if the school would be right for me? I also have a decent GRE score with me (since I did plan to got o US intially). I just want some insight into how I should be shortlisting schools, and what is a tuition fee range that is considered okay for an international student in EU?

I appreciate any advice that can point me in the right direction."
537,datascience,How NOT to write pandas code?,"I’ve been using pandas as my main tool for data analysis for the last 3 years. I must admit that most of “How NOT to code with pandas” comes from my beginnings. While doing code reviews I still see many of “Hot NOT to-s” with more experienced programmers.

# Sample Dataset

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    size = 10000
    cities = [""paris"", ""barcelona"", ""berlin"", ""new york""]
    df = pd.DataFrame(
        {""city"": np.random.choice(cities, size=size), ""booked_perc"": np.random.rand(size)}
    )
    df[""id""] = df.index.map(str) + ""-"" + df.city
    df = df[[""id"", ""city"", ""booked_perc""]]

# 1. How NOT to access previous values

Let’s calculate a percentage change from one row to another with and without a for a loop.

    %%timeit
    
    for i in range(1, len(df)):
        df.loc[i, ""perc_change""] =  (df.loc[i].booked_perc - df.loc[i - 1].booked_perc) / df.loc[i - 1].booked_perc
    
    7.02 s ± 24.4 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)

How to do it pandas way?

    %%timeit
    
    df[""perc_change""] = df.booked_perc.pct_change()
    
    586 µs ± 17.3 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)

# 2. How NOT to apply complex functions

Sometimes, we need to apply a complex function (a function with multiple variables) to a DataFrame. Let’s say we would like to multiply booking\_perc by two from New York, set others to 0 and name the column sales\_factor.

    %%timeit
    
    for i, row in df.iterrows():
        if row.city == 'new york':
            df.loc[i, 'sales_factor'] = row.booked_perc * 2
        else:
            df.loc[i, 'sales_factor'] = 0
    
    3.58 s ± 48.2 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each

How to do it pandas way?

    %%timeit
    
    def calculate_sales_factor(row):
        if row.city == 'new york':
            return row.booked_perc * 2
        return 0
    df['sales_factor'] = df.apply(calculate_sales_factor, axis=1)
    
    165 ms ± 2.48 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)

The fastest way is to use pandas filter and calculate the function values directly.

    %%timeit
    
    df.loc[df.city == 'new york', 'sales_factor'] = df[df.city == 'new york'].booked_perc * 2
df.sales_factor.fillna(0, inplace=True)
    
    3.03 ms ± 85.5 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)

We can observe the speedup from the first to the last example.

545,datascience,How much will DataCamp help me achieve a specific goal I have?,"I work as a pricing analyst in an insurance company and use SAS Enterprise Guide GLM to model motor insurance claim frequency and claim size. My understanding is very basic, but given the existing pricing benchmark, I was able to add value by adding some obvious independent variables such as suburb density, distance from CBD, census statistics etc. I do some basic data checks, data bandings, pick poisson for claims frequency or gamma for claim size, and then just pick the independent variables that have reasonable p values and makes logical sense.  


What I don't understand or do poorly is:

* Dealing with missing data within an observation  

* Data checks before proceeding to the modelling stage

* Model configurations other than the selection of poisson/gamma

* How to use the results to generate predictions for claims frequency/size for any given observation

* How to apply the model results on a training dataset (the third of claims experience not used in the model)

* Understanding how to interpret the model outputs other than the p value  

  
How much of this can DataCamp help me with? I would like to learn using R."

548,datascience,References on the emergence/history of data science?,"I am presently pursuing formal education with an ultimate goal of entering data science professionally. I have recently come to realize, however, that I really have very little understanding of data science as a field (in some cases, even so far as what distinguishes it from its composite fields). 

This is to some extent understandable, as the field is new and the dust really has yet to settle in many ways. However, obviously, fundamental confusion about one's intended profession is not really ideal. As such, I'm wondering if any one has some references to work on the history or development on the field. Frankly, I'd take personal narratives in the comments as well...I just don't want anyone to think I'm expecting them to write a novel for me.

I did find [50 Years of Data Science](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf) from 2015, which may well be the best I can get, but I don't know how accepted it might be."
549,datascience,Are there any data science projects that are focused on analyzing works of fiction?,"This might be breaking rule #9, but I haven't had much luck with Google.

I love to write fiction, but I am also studying for my masters in big data. For years I've wondered if it would ever be possible for a computer to write a book. And I don't mean the Harry Potter gibberish that some models have produced after reading the whole series. I mean a structured work of fiction that could pass for a human writer (even if it was only a mediocre one). I have experimented with a few models that just intake words and then spit them back out, but it's usually random garbage.

Has there been any work done on analyzing the structure of fiction writing (3 Acts, Hero's Journey, etc) that you know of? I am also interested in analyzing the emotions invoked by works of fiction. I know there's been a lot of work done with sentiment analysis, but what about analysis that classifies sections of text as sadness, surprise, anger, humor, joyful, etc?

I plan to do some of this analysis myself, but I just wanted to see what else was out there first. Thanks!"

What does these tell about the quality of predictions? I wrote that we should just stick with acc as we don't know the end result and we should chose f1 score when it has got some business cost associated and since we don't know the end goal, it is good to go with accuracy. What do you all think? Any help would be great."
551,datascience,Thoughts on using Fourier transform vs. other techniques to model seasonality?,"I needed to predict call volume for my work and was struggling to figure out how best to model it. Eventually, I decided to use the Fourier transform to help me. Basically, I ran the Fourier Transform on the residuals of a multivariate linear regression, then I filtered out low-signal values, got the sinusoid that corresponded to the remaining filtered Fourier values, and added it as a new variable to my regression. I wrote up a Medium article about it [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-add-fourier-terms-to-your-regression-seasonality-analysis-using-python-scipy-99a94d3ae51) if you're curious.  


To be honest, I couldn't find many resources about whether this method is valid. I also couldn't find many other ideas online on how to model seasonality in data. So I wanted to reach out to this subreddit to learn more.

So two questions:

* Is this Fourier transform methodology valid? What are the advantages/drawbacks?
* What alternate techniques are there to model seasonality in data?"

I have used a downloaded and updated dataset of club teams and their outcome attributes.

I have a train dataset with team names and their betting numbers. Based on these, Random tree classifier (This part is ML) will predict goal outcomes.

Example Output:

^(Round Number	Date	Location	HomeTeam	AwayTeam	FTHG\_P	FTAG\_P	FTHG\_Int\_P	FTAG\_Int\_P	FTHG\_Actual	FTAG\_Actual)

^(1	14/09/2020 20:00	Amex Stadium	Brighton	Chelsea	0.93	2.7	1	3	1	3)

Edit: Thank you for your words of encouragement. Its warming to know there are people who want to do this as well!

Edit: Verbose mumbling: I actually built this with a business problem at hand. I like to bet and I like to win. To win, you dont need to beat the bookie. You have to get your selections right. The more right you get, the more money you have.

The purpose is to enter as many competitions as our training data has and get out with a 70% win. So the data/information any gambler has before he/she gets into a bet is the teams playing/the involved parties. Now, the boundary condition would be the betting odds offerred but to know the rest of the features, you would need to have a knowledge bank of players, teams, stadiums, time of the year, etc. But, what if I wont have/am not interested to know? Hence, the boundary condition is just the team names and betting odds. Now, the training dataset has all the above required information. It has the team names (Cleaning this dataset was super hard but I got there, the scores (We also have other minute details like throws, half time scores, yellow cards, etc. but for now, we are concentrating on full time scores and the odds. I would expect the random tree (even if its averages, its not a bad place to start; I mean, if the classifier would predict 4 actual scores (Winning 1:17, 1:9.5, 1:21, 1:7.5 then, thats break-even for that class of bets for the season already!) to work pretty fine in this scenario. The way I would actually go about is to have h2h score and last 3 matches winning momentum but, I dont know how))

The bets we/I usually place are winningteam/draw and over 1.5 goals or under 3.5 goals. Within this boundary, the predictions fall nicely. Lets see how much I get right this week's EPL. I have placed a few I should know soon.

Though, I admit I suck at coding and at 35 years, I am just rolling with it. If i get stuck at a place, I take a long time to get out lol.

555,datascience,My first real-world M.L. project - guidance appreciated,"I am just starting my first data science project as an intern, which is a predictive analysis of customer churn. I've done some machine learning projects in school, using some of the classic M.L. data sets, e.g. the ones offered by Scikit. Despite this, I feel that I could use some advice as I'm entering this real-world project.

**Project information:**  
I've got hundreds of thousands of rows of data, spread across close to a hundred variables in our CRM system - I assume/predict that more than 80-90% of these variables are completely irrelevant for my purpose though. 

**Data types:**  
Most variables are binary (e.g. TRUE/FALSE) or multi-class (e.g. A, B, C, D, E), a few variables are continuous. 

**Class attribute:**  
I have a binary variable, ""customer\_lost"", that I will use as my class attribute, although it is drastically overweighted (90% NO, 10% YES). 

**MY QUESTIONS:**

1. What type of model would be best suited for this project? Logistic regression? Random Forest?
2. Given that I have almost 100 variables, is there a straightforward way to determine which variables I should use in my model, or do I need to use all of them?
3. Do I need to re-balance my data so that, in the training data, I have equally many ""NO"" and ""YES"" in the class attribute?
4. Is there anything in particular that I should keep in mind while conducting the project?

Would be extremely grateful for some advice!! Thanks in advance"

569,datascience,Thoughts on The Social Dilemma?,"There's a recently released Netflix documentary called ""The Social Dilemma"" that's been going somewhat viral and has made it's way into Netflix's list of trending videos.

The documentary is more or less an attack on social media platforms (mostly Facebook) and how they've steadily been contributing to tearing apart society for the better part of the last decade. There's interviews with a number of former top executives from Facebook, Twitter, Google, Pinterest (to name a few) and they explain how sites have used algorithms and AI to increase users' engagement, screen time, and addiction (and therefore profits), while leading to unintended negative consequences (the rise of confirmation bias, fake news, cyber bullying, etc). There's a lot of great information presented, none of which is that surprising for data scientists or those who have done even a little bit of research on social media.

In a way, it painted the practice of data science in a negative light, or at least how social media is unregulated (which I do agree it should be). But I know there's probably at least a few of you who have worked with social media data at one point or another, so I'd love to hear thoughts from those of you who have seen it."
570,datascience,Percentage of non traditional path Data Scientists in your team,"What is rough percentage of data scientist in your team who are not from math/physics/cs/statistics background. Basically, those who do not have bachelor or masters or PhD in above subjects."
573,datascience,On a team with no technical expertise--need advice on getting out/pivoting teams,"So for context, I'm currently a Business Analyst within the corporate finance division. My work is essentially developing business intelligence/analytics solutions that serve corporate finance only (ultimately creating dashboards in Power BI).

In other words, I am basically the middleman between finance and IT (all our DBAs/data engineers are housed in IT).

Day-to-day/projects are basically:

1. Finance proposes a business problem to me and we cook up some ideas for a dashboard
2. I translate this business need/requirements to IT
3. I work with IT to implement (I'm validating the data, they typically do ETL)
4. Once data is good, I create the dashboard

This is pretty stable, but in all honesty it's getting boring and I'm seeking more--I've been in this role for a year and being a dashboard monkey is something I believe I've outgrown. Ultimate goal is to be in a DE or DS role--would love to be in a more tech-heavy/developer role + do more forward looking analyses. Background is in Math/CS.

Being in the finance division actually gives me a lot of autonomy and gives me a deeper understanding of the business, but the tradeoff is that there's a lack of mentorship on the tech side. All my colleagues come from traditional accounting/finance backgrounds--I'm basically the ""IT guy"" of finance and the stuff I do is wizardry to them. I feel that the longer I stay, the more my career will stagnate. I would also love to learn more from/report directly to those with a technical role and know what they're doing.

Anyone have some insight? Wondering if there are other analysts who made the transition into DE or DS too."
574,datascience,Permutation importance (sklearn) for highly correlated data brings up multiple features from the same cluster,"Hi,

I ran permutation importance for data with high levels of correlation between each other. I clustered the data with hierarchical clustering on spearman rank-order correlations. I got nice results, but on closer inspection some of the features were from same cluster. Why would this happen?"
