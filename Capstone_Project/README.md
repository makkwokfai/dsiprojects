### Problem Statement

As a data scientist engaged by Singapore Poower, i am going to analyze the trend of household electricity consumption in Singapore.

Based on the data from 2005 to 2020, i am going to predict the household electricity consumption for 2021.


### Data Source

### Summary

This project examines data of the electrical consumption in Singapore from 2005 to 2020. This data is obtained from Kaggle, i have cross-checked it against the data given by Singstat and noticed they are the same.

Based on the data from 2005 to 2020, i am going to predict the household electricity consumption for 2021. For year 2020, i only have part of the data till July 2020.



### Conclusions

As Singapore enters phase 3 of circuit-breaker, the pace of economic recovery is slow as many people still Work from Home and the Home-Based Learning.

We foresee the rate of household electricity consumption of 2021 is higher than usual, and it is quite difficult to predict the actual household electricity consumption because of the usage pattern is different from past years.
